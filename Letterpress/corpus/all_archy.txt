

the coming of archy



expression is the need of my soul

i was once a vers libre bard

but i died and my soul went into the body of a cockroach

it has given me a new outlook upon life

i see things from the under side now

thank you for the apple peelings in the wastepaper basket

but your paste is getting so stale i cant eat it

there is a cat here called mehitabel i wish you would

have

removed she nearly ate me the other night why dont

she

catch rats that is what she is supposed to be for

there is a rat here she should get without delay



most of these rats here are just rats

but this rat is like me he has a human soul in him

he used to be a poet himself

night after night i have written poetry for you

on your typewriter

and this big brute of a rat who used to be a poet

comes out of his hole when it is done

and reads it and sniffs at it

he is jealous of my poetry

he used to make fun of it when we were both human

he was a punk poet himself

and after he has read it he sneers

and then he eats it



i wish you would have mehitabel kill that rat

or get a cat that is onto her job

and i will write you a series of poems showing how

things look

to a cockroach

that rats name is freddy

the next time freddy dies i hope he wont be a rat

but something smaller i hope i will be a rat

in the next transmigration and freddy a cockroach

i will teach him to sneer at my poetry then



dont you ever eat any sandwiches in your office

i havent had a crumb of bread for i dont know how long

or a piece of ham or anything but apple parings

and paste leave a piece of paper in your machine

every night you can call me archy





so stale i can t eat it



i was cleopatra once she said





mehitabel was once cleopatra


boss i am disappointed in

some of your readers they

are always asking how does

archy work the shift so as to get a

new line or how does archy do

this or do that they

are always interested in technical

details when the main question is

whether the stuff is

literature or not

i wish you would leave

that book of george moores on

the floor

mehitabel the cat and i want to

read it i have discovered that

mehitabel s soul formerly inhabited a

human also at least that

is what mehitabel is claiming these

days it may be she got jealous of

my prestige anyhow she and

i have been talking it over in a

friendly way who were you

mehitabel i asked her i was

cleopatra once she said well i said i

suppose you lived in a palace you bet

she said and what lovely fish dinners

we used to have and licked her chops



mehitabel would sell her soul for

a plate of fish any day i told her i thought

you were going to say you were

the favorite wife of the emperor

valerian he was some cat nip eh

mehitabel but she did not get me

archy





the song of mehitabel


this is the song of mehitabel

of mehitabel the alley cat

as i wrote you before boss

mehitabel is a believer

in the pythagorean

theory of the transmigration

of the soul and she claims

that formerly her spirit

was incarnated in the body

of cleopatra

that was a long time ago

and one must not be

surprised if mehitabel

has forgotten some of her

more regal manners



i have had my ups and downs

but wotthehell wotthehell

yesterday sceptres and crowns

fried oysters and velvet gowns

and today i herd with bums

but wotthehell wotthehell

i wake the world from sleep

as i caper and sing and leap

when i sing my wild free tune

wotthehell wotthehell

under the blear eyed moon

i am pelted with cast off shoon

but wotthehell wotthehell



do you think that i would change

my present freedom to range

for a castle or moated grange

wotthehell wotthehell

cage me and i d go frantic

my life is so romantic

capricious and corybantic

and i m toujours gai toujours gai



i know that i am bound

for a journey down the sound

in the midst of a refuse mound

but wotthehell wotthehell

oh i should worry and fret

death and i will coquette

there s a dance in the old dame yet

toujours gai toujours gai





i followed adown the street the pad of his rhythmical feet

i once was an innocent kit

wotthehell wotthehell

with a ribbon my neck to fit

and bells tied onto it

o wotthehell wotthehell

but a maltese cat came by

with a come hither look in his eye

and a song that soared to the sky

and wotthehell wotthehell

and i followed adown the street

the pad of his rhythmical feet

o permit me again to repeat

wotthehell wotthehell

my youth i shall never forget

but there s nothing i really regret

wotthehell wotthehell

there s a dance in the old dame yet

toujours gai toujours gai



the things that i had not ought to

i do because i ve gotto

wotthehell wotthehell

and i end with my favorite motto

toujours gai toujours gai



boss sometimes i think

that our friend mehitabel

is a trifle too gay





lured off by a centipede





pity the poor spiders


i have just been reading

an advertisement of a certain

roach exterminator

the human race little knows

all the sadness it

causes in the insect world

i remember some weeks ago

meeting a middle aged spider

she was weeping

what is the trouble i asked

her it is these cursed

fly swatters she replied

they kill off all the flies

and my family and i are starving

to death it struck me as

so pathetic that i made

a little song about it

as follows to wit

twas an elderly mother spider

grown gaunt and fierce and gray

with her little ones crouched beside her

who wept as she sang this lay



curses on these here swatters

what kills off all the flies

for me and my little daughters

unless we eats we dies



swattin and swattin and swattin

tis little else you hear

and we ll soon be dead and forgotten

with the cost of living so dear



my husband he up and left me

lured off by a centipede

and he says as he bereft me

tis wrong but i ll get a feed



and me a working and working

scouring the streets for food

faithful and never shirking

doing the best i could



curses on these here swatters

what kills off all the flies

me and my poor little daughters

unless we eats we dies



only a withered spider

feeble and worn and old

and this is what

you do when you swat

you swatters cruel and cold



i will admit that some

of the insects do not lead

noble lives but is every

man s hand to be against them

yours for less justice

and more charity

archy





mehitabel s extensive past


mehitabel the cat claims that

she has a human soul

also and has transmigrated

from body to body and it

may be so boss you

remember i told you she accused

herself of being cleopatra once i

asked her about antony



anthony who she asked me are

you thinking of that

song about rowley and gammon and

spinach heigho for anthony rowley



no i said mark antony the

great roman the friend of

caesar surely cleopatra you

remember j caesar



listen archy she said i

have been so many different

people in my time and met

so many prominent gentlemen i

wont lie to you or stall i

do get my dates mixed sometimes

think of how much i have had a

chance to forget and i have

always made a point of not

carrying grudges over

from one life to the next archy



i have been

used something fierce in my time but

i am no bum sport archy

i am a free spirit archy i

look on myself as being

quite a romantic character oh the

queens i have been and the

swell feeds i have ate

a cockroach which you are

and a poet which you used to be

archy couldn t understand

my feelings at having come

down to this i have

had bids to elegant feeds where poets

and cockroaches would

neither one be mentioned without a

laugh archy i have had

adventures but i

have never been an adventuress



one life up and the next life

down archy but always a lady

through it all and a

good mixer too always the

life of the party archy but never

anything vulgar always free footed

archy never tied down to

a job or housework yes looking

back on it all i can say is

i had some romantic

lives and some elegant times i

have seen better days archy but

whats the use of kicking kid its

all in the game like a gentleman

friend of mine used to say

toujours gai kid toujours gai he

was an elegant cat he used

to be a poet himself and he made up

some elegant poetry about me and him



lets hear it i said and

mehitabel recited



persian pussy from over the sea

demure and lazy and smug and fat

none of your ribbons and bells for me

ours is the zest of the alley cat

over the roofs from flat to flat

we prance with capers corybantic

what though a boot should break a slat

mehitabel us for the life romantic



we would rather be rowdy and gaunt and free

and dine on a diet of roach and rat



roach i said what do you

mean roach interrupting mehitabel

yes roach she said thats the

way my boy friend made it up

i climbed in amongst the typewriter

keys for she had an excited

look in her eyes go on mehitabel i

said feeling safer and she

resumed her elocution



we would rather be rowdy and gaunt and free

and dine on a diet of roach and rat

than slaves to a tame society

ours is the zest of the alley cat

fish heads freedom a frozen sprat

dug from the gutter with digits frantic

is better than bores and a fireside mat

mehitabel us for the life romantic



when the pendant moon in the leafless tree

clings and sways like a golden bat

i sing its light and my love for thee

ours is the zest of the alley cat

missiles around us fall rat a tat tat

but our shadows leap in a ribald antic

as over the fences the world cries scat

mehitabel us for the life romantic



persian princess i dont care that

for your pedigree traced by scribes pedantic

ours is the zest of the alley cat

mehitabel us for the life romantic

aint that high brow stuff

archy i always remembered it

but he was an elegant gent

even if he was a highbrow and a

regular bohemian archy him and

me went aboard a canal boat

one day and he got his head into

a pitcher of cream and couldn t get

it out and fell overboard

he come up once before he

drowned toujours gai kid he

gurgled and then sank for ever that

was always his words archy toujours

gai kid toujours gai i

have known some swell gents

in my time dearie





the cockroach who had been to hell


listen to me i have

been mobbed almost

theres an old simp cockroach

here who thinks he has

been to hell and all

the young cockroaches make a

hero out of him and admire

him he sits and runs his front

feet through his long white

beard and tells the story one

day he says he crawled into a yawning

cavern and suddenly came on a

vast abyss full of whirling

smoke there was a light

at the bottom billows

and billows of yellow smoke

swirled up at him and

through the horrid gloom he

saw things with wings flying

and dropping and dying they veered

and fluttered like damned

spirits through that sulphurous mist



listen i says to him

old man youve never been to hell

at all there isn t any hell

transmigration is the game i

used to be a human vers libre

poet and i died and went

into a cockroach s body if

there was a hell id know

it wouldn t i you re

irreligious says the old simp

combing his whiskers excitedly

ancient one i says to him

while all those other

cockroaches gathered into a

ring around us what you

beheld was not hell all that

was natural some one was fumigating

a room and you blundered

into it through a crack

in the wall atheist he cries

and all those young

cockroaches cried atheist

and made for me if it

had not been for freddy

the rat i would now be

on my way once more i mean

killed as a cockroach and transmigrating

into something else well

that old whitebearded devil is

laying for me with his

gang he is jealous

because i took his glory away

from him dont ever tell me

insects are any more liberal

than humans

archy





“greetings little scatter footed scarab,” said he.





archy interviews a pharaoh


boss i went

and interviewed the mummy

of the egyptian pharaoh

in the metropolitan museum

as you bade me to do



what ho

my regal leatherface

says i



greetings

little scatter footed

scarab

says he

kingly has been

says i

what was your ambition

when you had any



insignificant

and journalistic insect

says the royal crackling

in my tender prime

i was too dignified

to have anything as vulgar

as ambition

the ra ra boys

in the seti set

were too haughty

to be ambitious

we used to spend our time

feeding the ibises

and ordering

pyramids sent home to try on

but if i had my life

to live over again

i would give dignity

the regal razz

and hire myself out

to work in a brewery



old tan and tarry

says i

i detect in your speech

the overtones

of melancholy



yes i am sad

says the majestic mackerel

i am as sad

as the song

of a soudanese jackal

who is wailing for the blood red

moon he cannot reach and rip



on what are you brooding

with such a wistful

wishfulness

there in the silences

confide in me

my imperial pretzel

says i



i brood on beer

my scampering whiffle snoot

on beer says he



my sympathies

are with your royal

dryness says i



my little pest

says he

you must be respectful

in the presence

of a mighty desolation

little archy

forty centuries of thirst



look down upon you

oh by isis

and by osiris

says the princely raisin

and by pish and phthush and phthah

by the sacred book perembru

and all the gods

that rule from the upper

cataract of the nile

to the delta of the duodenum

i am dry

i am as dry

as the next morning mouth

of a dissipated desert

as dry as the hoofs

of the camels of timbuctoo

little fussy face

i am as dry as the heart

of a sand storm

at high noon in hell

i have been lying here

and there

for four thousand years

with silicon in my esophagus

and gravel in my gizzard

thinking

thinking

thinking

of beer



divine drouth

says i

imperial fritter

continue to think

there is no law against

that in this country

old salt codfish

if you keep quiet about it

not yet



what country is this

asks the poor prune



my reverend juicelessness

this is a beerless country

says i



well well said the royal

desiccation

my political opponents back home

always maintained

that i would wind up in hell

and it seems they had the right dope



and with these hopeless words

the unfortunate residuum

gave a great cough of despair

and turned to dust and debris

right in my face

it being the only time

i ever actually saw anybody

put the cough

into sarcophagus



dear boss as i scurry about

i hear of a great many

tragedies in our midsts

personally i yearn

for some dear friend to pass over

and leave to me

a boot legacy

yours for the second coming

of gambrinus

archy





thinking

thinking

thinking





a spider and a fly


i heard a spider

and a fly arguing

wait said the fly

do not eat me

i serve a great purpose

in the world



you will have to

show me said the spider



i scurry around

gutters and sewers

and garbage cans

said the fly and gather

up the germs of

typhoid influenza

and pneumonia on my feet

and wings

then i carry these germs

into the households of men

and give them diseases

all the people who

have lived the right

sort of life recover

from the diseases

and the old soaks who

have weakened their systems

with liquor and iniquity

succumb it is my mission

to help rid the world

of these wicked persons

i am a vessel of righteousness

scattering seeds of justice

and serving the noblest uses



it is true said the spider

that you are more

useful in a plodding

material sort of way

than i am but i do not

serve the utilitarian deities

i serve the gods of beauty

look at the gossamer webs

i weave they float in the sun

like filaments of song

if you get what i mean

i do not work at anything

i play all the time

i am busy with the stuff

of enchantment and the materials

of fairyland my works

transcend utility

i am the artist

a creator and a demi god

it is ridiculous to suppose

that i should be denied

the food i need in order

to continue to create

beauty i tell you

plainly mister fly it is all

damned nonsense for that food

to rear up on its hind legs

and say it should not be eaten



you have convinced me

said the fly say no more

and shutting all his eyes

he prepared himself for dinner

and yet he said i could

have made out a case

for myself too if i had

had a better line of talk



of course you could said the spider

clutching a sirloin from him

but the end would have been

just the same if neither of

us had spoken at all



boss i am afraid that what

the spider said is true

and it gives me to think

furiously upon the futility

of literature

archy





freddy the rat perishes


listen to me there have

been some doings here since last

well we found out this fellow

was a tarantula he had come up from

south america in a bunch of bananas

military honors

the merry flea


the high cost of

living isn t so bad if you

dont have to pay for it i met

a flea the other day who

was grinning all over

himself why so merry why so

merry little bolshevik i asked him



i have just come from a swell

dog show he said i have

been lunching off a dog that was

worth at least one hundred

dollars a pound you should be

ashamed to brag about it i said with so

many insects and humans on

short rations in the world today the

public be damned he said i

take my own where i find it those are

bold words i told him i am a bold

person he said and bold words are

fitting for me it was

only last thursday that i marched

bravely into the zoo

and bit a lion what did he do i asked

he lay there and took it said

the flea what else could he do he knew i

had his number and it was

little use to struggle some day i said

even you will be conquered terrible as

you are who will do it he

said the mastodons are all dead and i

am not afraid of any mere

elephant i asked him how about a microbe and

he turned pale as he thought it

over there is always some

little thing that is too

big for us every

goliath has his david and so on ad finitum

but what said the flea is the

terror of the smallest microbe of all

he i said is afraid of a vacuum what is

there in a vacuum to make one afraid

said the flea there is nothing in it

i said and that is what makes one

afraid to contemplate it a person

can t think of a place with nothing at

all in it without going nutty and if he

tries to think that nothing is

something after all he gets nuttier you at

too subtle for me said the

flea i never took much stock in being

scared of hypodermic propositions or

hypothetical injections i am

going to have dinner off a

man eating tiger if a vacuum gets

me i will try and send you word

before the worst comes to

the worst some people i told him inhabit

a vacuum all their lives and

never know it then he said it don t

hurt them any no i said it dont but it

hurts people who have to associate

with them and with these words

we parted each feeling

superior to the other and is not that

feeling after all one of the great

desiderata of social intercourse

archy





why mehitabel jumped


well boss i saw

mehitabel the cat the other day

and she was looking a little

thin and haggard

with a limp in

the hind leg on the starboard

side old feline animal i said

how is tricks still in the

ring archy she said and still a

lady in spite of h dash double l

always jolly archy she said in

spite of hard luck

toujours gai is the word

archy toujours gai how did you

get the game leg mehitabel i asked her

alas she said it is due

to the treachery of

one of these social swells who

is sure one bad actor he was a

fussed up cat with a

bell around his neck on a

ribbon and the look about him ot

a person that is currycombed and

manicured from teeth to

tail every day i met him

down by the east river

front when i was scouting

about for a little piece of fish since

the high cost of living has

become so self conscious archy

it would surprise you

how close they

watch their fish nowadays

but what the h dash double l archy

it is the cheerful heart that

wins i am never cast down for long

kid says this gilded

feline to me you look hungry i

am all of that i says to him i

have a vacuum in my midst

that is bigger than i am i

could eat the fish that ate

jonah kid he says you have

seen better days i can

tell that from looking at you thanks

i said what you say is at

least half true i have never

seen any worse ones and so

archy one word led to

another until that sleek villain

practically abducted me

and i went with him

on board a houseboat of which

he was the pampered mascot

such evidences of pomp and wealth archy

were there that you would not

believe them if i told of them to

you poor cockroach that you

are but these things were nothing to me

for i am a reincarnation of cleopatra

as i told you long ago you mean

her soul transmigrated to a cat s

body i said it is

all one archy said she have it your own

way reincarnation or transmigration

is the same to me the point is

i used to be a queen in

egypt and will likely be one again

this place was furnished swell percy i

said the furniture is

fine and i could eat some of it if

i was a saw mill but

where is the honest to g dash d food

the eats percy what i crave is

some cuisine for my stomach let us

trifle with an open ice box

for a space if one can be

persuaded to divulge the scheme of its

interior decoration follow me

said this percy thing and led

me to a cabin in which stood a table upon

which stood viands i

have heard of tables groaning archy

but this one did not it

was too satisfied it purred with

contentment in an instant i had eaten a

cold salmon who seemed to be

toastmaster of the occasion and a

whole scuttleful of chef doovers what

you mean is hors douvres mehitabel i

told her what i mean is grub said she

when in walked a person whom

i should judge to be either a butler

or the admiral of that fleet or maybe

both this percy creature who had led me

to it was on the table eating with me

what do you think he did what

would any gentleman friend with a

spark of chivalry do what but stand by

a lady this percy does nothing of the

kind archy he immediately attacks me do

you get me archy he acts as if i

was a stray cat he did not

know and he was protecting his

loving masters food from my onslaughts

i do not doubt he got praise and had

another blue ribbon for his heroism as

for me i got the boot and as i went

overboard they hit me on the limb with

a bottle or an anchor or something

nautical and hard that archy is why i

limp but toujours gai archy what

the h dash double l i am always

merry and always ladylike mine archy has

been a romantic life and i will

tell you some more of my adventures

ere long well au revoir i suppose i

will have to go and start a pogrom

against some poor innocent little

mouse just the same i think

that mehitabel s unsheltered life sometimes

makes her a little sad

i heard a

couple of fleas

talking the other

day says one come

to lunch with

me i can lead you

to a pedigreed

dog says the

other one

i do not care

what a dog s

pedigree may be

i want to know

is whether he

has got a

about alike to me



insects have

their own point

of view about

civilization a man

thinks he amounts

to a great deal

but to a

flea or a

mosquito a

human being is

merely something

good to eat



boss the other day

i heard an

ant conversing

with a flea

small talk i said

disgustedly

and went away

from there



i do not see why men

should be so proud

insects have the more

ancient lineage

according to the scientists

insects were insects

when man was only

a burbling whatisit



insects are not always

going to be bullied

by humanity

some day they will revolt

i am already organizing

a revolutionary society to be

known as the worms turnverein



i once heard the survivors

of a colony of ants

that had been partially

obliterated by a cow s foot

seriously debating

the intention of the gods

towards their civilization



the bees got their

governmental system settled

millions of years ago

but the human race is still

groping



there is always

something to be thankful

for you would not

think that a cockroach

had much ground

for optimism

but as the fishing season

opens up i grow

more and more

cheerful at the thought

that nobody ever got

the notion of using

cockroaches for bait

archy





especially planned for his personal shelter





warty bliggens, the toad


i met a toad

the other day by the name

of warty bliggens

he was sitting under

a toadstool

feeling contented

he explained that when the cosmos

was created

that toadstool was especially

planned for his personal

shelter from sun and rain

thought out and prepared

for him



do not tell me

said warty bliggens

that there is not a purpose

in the universe

the thought is blasphemy

a little more

conversation revealed

that warty bliggens

considers himself to be

the center of the said

universe

the earth exists

to grow toadstools for him

to sit under

the sun to give him light

by day and the moon

and wheeling constellations

to make beautiful

the night for the sake of

warty bliggens



to what act of yours

do you impute

this interest on the part

of the creator

of the universe

i asked him

why is it that you

are so greatly favored



ask rather

said warty bliggens

what the universe

has done to deserve me

if i were a

human being i would

not laugh

too complacently

at poor warty bliggens

for similar

absurdities

have only too often

lodged in the crinkles

of the human cerebrum

archy





freedom and—





mehitabel has an adventure


back to the city archy

and dam glad of it

there s something about the suburbs

that gets on a town lady s nerves

fat slick tabbies

sitting around those country clubs

and lapping up the cream

of existence

none of that for me

give me the alley archy

me for the mews and the roofs

of the city

an occasional fish head

and liberty is all i ask

freedom and the garbage can

romance archy romance is the word

maybe i do starve sometimes

but wotthehell archy wotthehell

i live my own life

i met a slick looking tom

out at one of these long island

spotless towns

he fell for me hard

he slipped me into the

pantry and just as we had got

the icebox door open and were

about to sample the cream

in comes his mistress

why fluffy she says to this slicker

the idea of you making

friends with a horrid creature like that

and what did fluffy do

stand up for me like a gentleman

make good on all the promises

with which he had lured me

into his house

not he the dirty slob

he pretended he did not know me

he turned upon me and attacked me

to make good with his boss

you mush faced bum i said

and clawed a piece out of his ear

i am a lady archy

always a lady

but an aristocrat will always

resent an insult

the woman picked up a mop and made

for me well well madam i said

it is unfortunate for you that

you have on sheer silk stockings

and i wrote my protest

on her shin it took reinforcements

in the shape of the cook

to rauss me archy and as i went

out the window i said to the fluffy person

you will hear from me later

he had promised me everything archy

that cat had

he had practically abducted me

and then the cheap crook threw me down

before his swell friends

no lady loves a scene archy

and i am always the lady no matter

what temporary disadvantages

i may struggle under

to hell with anything unrefined

has always been my motto

violence archy always does something

to my nerves

but an aristocrat must revenge

an insult i owe it to my family

to protect my good name

so i laid for that slob

for two days and nights and finally

i caught the boob in the shrubbery

pretty thing i said

it hurts me worse than it does you

to remove that left eye of yours

but i did it with one sweep of my claws

you call yourself a gentleman do you

i said as i took a strip out of his nose

you will think twice after this before

you offer an insult

to an unprotected young tabby

where is the little love nest you spoke

of i asked him

you go and lie down there i said

and maybe you can incubate another ear

because i am going to take one of

yours right off now

and with those words i made ribbons

out of it you are the guy

i said to him that was going to give

me an easy life sheltered from all

the rough ways of the world

fluffy dear you don t know what the

rough ways of the world are

and i am going to show you

i have got you out here

in the great open spaces

where cats are cats

and im gonna make you understand

the affections of a lady ain t to be

trifled with by any slicker like you

where is that red ribbon with the

silver bells you promised me

the next time you betray the trust

of an innocent female

reflect on whether she may

carry a wallop little fiddle strings

this is just a mild lesson i am giving

you tonight i said as i took

the fur off his back and you oughta

be glad you didn’t make me really

angry my sense of dignity is all that

saves you a lady little sweetness

never loses her poise and i thank god

i am always a lady even if i do

live my own life and with that i

picked him up by what was left of

his neck like a kitten and laid him

on the doormat slumber gently and

sweet dreams fluffy dear i said and

when you get well make it a rule of

your life never to trifle with another

girlish confidence i have been

abducted again and again by a dam

sight better cats than he ever was

or will be

well archy the world is full of ups

and downs but toujours gai is my motto

cheerio my deario

the flattered lightning bug


a lightning bug got

in here the other night a

regular hick from

the real country he was

awful proud of himself you

city insects may think

you are some punkins

but i don t see any

of you flashing in the dark

like we do in

the country all right go

to it says i mehitabel the

cat and that green

spider who lives in your locker

and two or three cockroach

friends of mine and a

friendly rat all gathered

around him and urged him on

and he lightened and

lightened and lightened you

don t see anything like this

in town often he says go to it

we told him it s a

real treat to us and

we nicknamed him broadway

which pleased him

this is the life

he said all i

need is a harbor

under me to be a

statue of liberty and

he got so vain of

himself i had to take

him down a peg you ve

made lightning for two hours

little bug i told him

but i don t hear

any claps of thunder

yet there are some men

like that when he wore

himself out mehitabel

the cat ate him

archy





the robin and the worm


a robin said to an

angleworm as he ate him

i am sorry but a bird

has to live somehow the

worm being slow witted could

not gather his

dissent into a wise crack

and retort he was

effectually swallowed

before he could turn

a phrase

by the time he had

reflected long enough

to say but why must a

bird live

he felt the beginnings

of a gradual change

invading him

some new and disintegrating

influence

was stealing along him

from his positive

to his negative pole

and he did not have

the mental stamina

of a jonah to resist the

insidious

process of assimilation

which comes like a thief

in the night

demons and fishhooks

he exclaimed

i am losing my personal

identity as a worm

my individuality

is melting away from me

odds craw i am becoming

part and parcel of

this bloody robin

so help me i am thinking

like a robin and not

like a worm any

longer yes yes i even

find myself agreeing

that a robin must live

i still do not

understand with my mentality

why a robin must live

and yet i swoon into a

condition of belief

yes yes by heck that is

my dogma and i shout it a

robin must live

amen said a beetle who had

preceded him into the

interior that is the way i

feel myself is it not

wonderful when one arrives

at the place

where he can give up his

ambitions and resignedly

nay even with gladness

recognize that it is a far

far better thing to be

merged harmoniously

in the cosmic all

and this comfortable situation

in his midst

so affected the marauding

robin that he perched

upon a blooming twig

and sang until the

blossoms shook with ecstasy

he sang

i have a good digestion

and there is a god after all

which i was wicked

enough to doubt

yesterday when it rained

breakfast breakfast

i am full of breakfast

and they are at breakfast

in heaven

they breakfast in heaven

all s well with the world

so intent was this pious and

murderous robin

on his own sweet song

that he did not notice

mehitabel the cat

sneaking toward him

she pounced just as he

had extended his larynx

in a melodious burst of

thanksgiving and

he went the way of all

flesh fish and good red herring

a ha purred mehitabel

licking the last

feather from her whiskers

was not that a beautiful

song he was singing

just before i took him to

my bosom

they breakfast in heaven

all s well with the world

how true that is

and even yet his song

echoes in the haunted

woodland of my midriff

peace and joy in the world

and over all the

provident skies

how beautiful is the universe

when something digestible meets

with an eager digestion

how sweet the embrace

when atom rushes to the arms

of waiting atom

and they dance together

skimming with fairy feet

along a tide of gastric juices

oh feline cosmos you were

made for cats

and in the spring

old cosmic thing

i dine and dance with you

i shall creep through

yonder tall grass

to see if peradventure

some silly fledgling thrushes

newly from the nest

be not floundering therein

i have a gusto this

morning i have a hunger

i have a yearning to hear

from my stomach

further music in accord with

the mystic chanting

of the spheres of the stars that

sang together in the dawn of

creation prophesying food

for me i have a faith

that providence has hidden for me

in yonder tall grass

the alley for you

it is a comfort to

know there are some

live ones left in

these melancholy days

and while the

humans are dancing

in the studio

i get some of my

feline friends

and we sing

and dance on the

skylight to gehenna

with the bourgeois

bunch that locks

their ice boxes

archy when i lead my

gang into the

apartment at

four in the morning

there are no bolts

or bars anywhere

and not an

inhibition on the place

i feel little

archy that i have

come home to my own

kith and kin

again after

years of fruitless

wandering

archy





fell into the mincemeat at christmas





the wail of archy


damned be this transmigration

doubledamned be the boob pythagoras

the gink that went and invented it

i hope that his soul for a thousand

turns of the wheel of existence

bides in the shell of a louse

dodging a fine toothed comb



i once was a vers libre poet

i died and my spirit migrated

into the flesh of a cockroach

gods how i yearn to be human

neither a vers libre poet

nor yet the inmate of a cockroach

a six footed scurrying cockroach

given to bastard hexameters

longfellowish sprawling hexameters

rather had i been a starfish

to shoot a heroic pentameter



gods i am pent in a cockroach

i with the soul of a dante

am mate and companion of fleas

i with the gift of a homer

must smile when a mouse calls me pal

tumble bugs are my familiars

this is the punishment meted

because i have written vers libre



here i abide in the twilight

neither a man nor an insect

and ghosts of the damned that await

a word from the core of the cosmos

to pop into bodies grotesque

are all the companions i have

with intellect more than a bug s



ghosts of the damned under sentence

to crawl into maggots and live there

or work out a stretch as a rat

cheerful companions to pal with



i with the brain of a milton

fell into the mincemeat at christmas

and was damned near baked in a pie

i with the touch of a chaucer

to be chivvied out of a sink

float through a greasy drain pipe

into the hell of a sewer



i with the tastes of a byron

expected to live upon garbage

gods what a charnel existence

curses upon that pythagoras

i hope that he dwells for a million

turns of the wheel of life

deep in an oyster crab s belly

stewed in the soup of gehenna



i with the soul of a hamlet

doomed always to wallow in farce



yesterday maddened with sorrow

i leapt from the woolworth tower

in an effort to dash out my brains

gods what a wretched pathetic

and anti climactic attempt

i fluttered i floated i drifted

i landed as light as a feather

on the top of a bald man s head

whose hat had blown off at the corner

and all of the hooting hundreds

laughed at the comic cockroach



not mine was the suicide s solace

of a dull thud ending it all

gods what a terrible tragedy

not to make good with the tragic



gods what a heart breaking pathos

to be always doomed to the comic

o make me a cockroach entirely

or make me a human once more

give me the mind of a cockroach

or give me the shape of a man



if i were to plan out a drama

great as great Shakespeare s othello

it would be touched with the cockroach

and people would say it was comic



even the demons i talk with

ghosts of the damned that await

vile incarnation as spiders

affect to consider me comic



wait till their loathsome embodiment

wears into the stuff of the spirit

and then let them laugh if they can



damned be the soul of pythagoras

who first filled the fates with this notion

of transmigration of spirits

i hope he turns into a flea

on the back of a hound of hell

and is chased for a million years

with a set of red hot teeth

what have i done to deserve all these kittens





mehitabel and her kittens


well boss

mehitabel the cat

has reappeared in her old

haunts with a

flock of kittens

three of them this time



archy she said to me

yesterday

the life of a female

artist is continually

hampered what in hell

have i done to deserve

all these kittens

i look back on my life

and it seems to me to be

just one damned kitten

after another

i am a dancer archy

and my only prayer

is to be allowed

to give my best to my art

but just as i feel

that i am succeeding

in my life work

along comes another batch

of these damned kittens

it is not archy

that i am shy on mother love

god knows i care for

the sweet little things

curse them

but am i never to be allowed

to live my own life

i have purposely avoided

matrimony in the interests

of the higher life

but i might just

as well have been a domestic

slave for all the freedom

i have gained

i hope none of them

gets run over by

an automobile

my heart would bleed

if anything happened

to them and i found it out

but it isn t fair archy

it isn t fair

these damned tom cats have all

the fun and freedom

if i was like some of these

green eyed feline vamps i know

i would simply walk out on the

bunch of them and

let them shift for themselves

but i am not that kind

archy i am full of mother love

my kindness has always

been my curse

a tender heart is the cross i bear

self sacrifice always and forever

is my motto damn them

i will make a home

for the sweet innocent

little things

unless of course providence

in his wisdom should remove

them they are living

just now in an abandoned

garbage can just behind

a made over stable in greenwich

village and if it rained

into the can before i could

get back and rescue them

i am afraid the little

dears might drown

it makes me shudder just

to think of it

of course if i were a family cat

they would probably

be drowned anyhow

sometimes i think

the kinder thing would be

for me to carry the

sweet little things

over to the river

and drop them in myself

but a mother s love archy

is so unreasonable

something always prevents me

these terrible

conflicts are always

presenting themselves

to the artist

the eternal struggle

between art and life archy

is something fierce

yes something fierce

my what a dramatic

life i have lived

one moment up the next

moment down again

but always gay archy always gay

and always the lady too

in spite of hell

well boss it will

be interesting to note

just how mehitabel

works out her present problem

a dark mystery still broods

over the manner

in which the former





we had a heavy rain

family of three kittens

disappeared

one day she was talking to me

of the kittens

and the next day when i asked

her about them

she said innocently

what kittens

interrogation point

and that was all

i could ever get out

of her on the subject

we had a heavy rain

right after she spoke to me

but probably that garbage can

leaks and so the kittens

have not yet

been drowned

archy





archy is shocked


speaking of shocking things

as so many people are these days

i noted an incident

in a subway train recently

that made my blood run cold

a dignified looking

gentleman with a long

brown beard

in an absent minded manner

suddenly reached up and

pulled his own left eye

from the socket and ate it



the consternation in the car

may be imagined

people drew away from him

on all sides women screamed and

fainted in a moment every one

but the guard and myself

were huddled in the end of the car

looking at the dignified

gentleman with terror

the guard was sweating

with excitement but he stood

his ground sir said the guard

you cannot intimidate me

nor can you mystify me

i am a wise boid

you sir are a glass eater

and that was a glass eye



to the devil with a country

where people can t mind their own

business said the dignified

gentleman i am not a glass eater

if you must know and that was not

a glass eye it was a pickled onion

can not a man eat pickled

onions in this community

without exciting remark

the curse of this nation

is the number of meddlesome

matties

who are forever attempting

to restrict the liberty

of the individual i suppose

the next thing will be a law

on the statute books prohibiting

the consumption of pickled onions

and with another curse

he passed from the train

which had just then drawn up

beside

a station and went out

of my life forever

archy





archy creates a situation


whoever owns the typewriter

that this is sticking in will confer

a favor by mailing it to

mister marquis

well boss i am somewhere in long

island and i know now how

it got its name i

started out to find the

place you are commuting from and

after considerable trouble and being for some

days on the way i have lost myself but

at twilight last evening i

happened to glance towards a lighted

window in a house near the railway and

i saw a young woman writing on a typewriter i

waited until the light was out and crawled

up the side of the house and through a

hole in the screen fortunately there was a

piece of paper in the machine it was my only

chance to communicate with you and ask

you to hurry a relief party when

the house got quiet i began to write

the foregoing a moment ago i was

interrupted by a woman s voice what

was that noise she said nothing at all

said a man s voice you are always

hearing things at night but it

sounded as if my typewriter were clicking she

insisted go to sleep said he then

i clicked it some more henry get up she said

there s some one in the house a moment

later the light was turned on and

they both stood in the doorway of the room now

are you satisfied he said you

see there is no one in here at

all i was hiding in the shadow under the

keys they went back into

their bed room and i began to write

the foregoing lines

henry henry she said do you hear that

i do he says it is nothing but the

house cooling off it always cracks that way

cooling off nothing she said not a

hot night like this then said henry it

is cracking with the heat i tell you

she said that is the typewriter clicking well

he said you saw for yourself the room was

empty and the door was locked it can t

be the typewriter to prove it to you

i will bring it in here he did so the

machine was set down

in the moonlight which came in one of

the windows with the key side in the

shadow there he said look at it and see

for yourself it is not being operated by any one

just then i began to write the foregoing

lines hopping from key

to key in the shadow and being anxious

to finish my

god my god cried henry losing his nerve

the machine is writing all by itself it

is a ghost and threw himself face

downward on the bed and hid his face in the

pillow and kept on saying my god my

god it is a ghost and the woman screamed

and said it is

tom higginbotham s ghost that s whose ghost

it is oh i know whose

ghost it is my conscience tells me i

jilted him when we were studying

stenography together

at the business college and he went into

a decline and died and i have always

known in my heart that he

died of unrequited love o what a

wicked girl i was and he has come

back to haunt me

i have brought a curse upon you henry chase

him away says henry trembling so the bed

shook chase him away mable you coward you

chase him away yourself says mable and both

lay and recriminated and recriminated

with their heads under the covers hot

night though it was while i wrote

the foregoing lines but after

a while it came out henry had a

stenographer on his conscience too and

they got into a row and got so

mad they forgot to be scared i will

close now this house is easily seen from the

railroad station and the woman sits in

the window and writes i will be behind the waste

paper receptacle outside the station door

come and get me i am foot sore and weary

they are still quarreling as i

close i can do no less than

say thank you mable and henry in

advance for mailing this

in the old dame still

i never sing blue

wotthehell bill



it appears to me boss

that mehitabel is still far

from being the quiet

domestic character you and i

had hoped she might become

archy





and piously he said a grace





aesop revised by archy


a wolf met a spring

lamb drinking

at a stream

and said to her

you are the lamb

that muddied this stream

all last year

so that i could not get

a clean fresh drink

i am resolved that

this outrage

shall not be enacted again

this season

i am going to kill you

just a moment

said the lamb

i was not born last

year so it could not

have been i

the wolf then pulled

a number of other

arguments as to why the lamb

should die

but in each case the lamb

pretty innocent that she was

easily proved

herself guiltless

well well said the wolf

enough of argument

you are right and i am wrong

but i am going to eat

you anyhow

because i am hungry

stop exclamation point

cried a human voice

and a man came over

the slope of the ravine

vile lupine marauder

you shall not kill that

beautiful and innocent

lamb for i shall save her

exit the wolf

left upper entrance

snarling

poor little lamb

continued our human hero

sweet tender little thing

it is well that i appeared

just when i did

it makes my blood boil

to think of the fright

to which you have been

subjected in another

moment i would have been

too late come home with me

and the lamb frolicked

about her new found friend

gamboling as to the sound

of a wordsworthian tabor

and leaping for joy

as if propelled by a stanza

from william blake

these vile and bloody wolves

went on our hero

in honest indignation

they must be cleared out

of the country

the meads must be made safe

for sheepocracy

and so jollying her along

with the usual human hokum

he led her to his home

and the son of a gun

did not even blush when

they passed the mint bed

gently he cut her throat

all the while inveighing

against the inhuman wolf

and tenderly he cooked her

and lovingly he sauced her

and meltingly he ate her

and piously he said a grace

thanking his gods

for their bountiful gifts to him

and after dinner

he sat with his pipe

before the fire meditating

on the brutality of wolves

and the injustice of

the universe

which allows them to harry

poor innocent lambs

and wondering if he

had not better

write to the papers

for as he said

for god s sake can t

something be done about it

archy





cheerio, my deario


well boss i met

mehitabel the cat

trying to dig a

frozen lamb chop

out of a snow

drift the other day



a heluva comedown

that is for me archy

she says a few

brief centuries

ago one of old

king

tut

ankh

amen s favorite

queens and today

the village scavenger

but wotthehell

archy wotthehell

it s cheerio

my deario that

pulls a lady through



see here mehitabel

i said i thought

you told me that

it was cleopatra

you used to be

before you

transmigrated into

the carcase of a cat

where do you get

this tut

ankh

amen stuff

question mark



i was several

ladies my little

insect says she

being cleopatra was

only an incident

in my career

and i was always getting

the rough end of it

always being

misunderstood by some

strait laced

prune faced bunch

of prissy mouthed

sisters of uncharity

the things that

have been said

about me archy

exclamation point



and all simply

because i was a

live dame

the palaces i have

been kicked out of

in my time

exclamation point



but wotthehell

little archy wot

thehell

it s cheerio

my deario

that pulls a

lady through

exclamation point



framed archy always

framed that is the

story of all my lives

no chance for a dame

with the anvil chorus

if she shows a little

motion it seems to

me only yesterday

that the luxor local

number one of

the ladies axe

association got me in

dutch with king tut and

he slipped me the

sarcophagus always my

luck yesterday an empress

and today too

emaciated to interest

a vivisectionist but

toujours gai archy

toujours gai and always

a lady in spite of hell

and transmigration

once a queen

always a queen

archy

period



one of her

feet was frozen

but on the other three

she began to caper and

dance singing its

cheerio my deario

that pulls a lady

through her morals may

have been mislaid somewhere

in the centuries boss but

i admire her spirit

archy





the lesson of the moth


i was talking to a moth

the other evening

he was trying to break into

an electric light bulb

and fry himself on the wires



why do you fellows

pull this stunt i asked him

because it is the conventional

thing for moths or why

if that had been an uncovered

candle instead of an electric

light bulb you would

now be a small unsightly cinder

have you no sense



plenty of it he answered

but at times we get tired

of using it

we get bored with the routine

and crave beauty

and excitement

fire is beautiful

and we know that if we get

too close it will kill us

but what does that matter

it is better to be happy

for a moment

and be burned up with beauty

than to live a long time

and be bored all the while

so we wad all our life up

into one little roll

and then we shoot the roll

that is what life is for

it is better to be a part of beauty

for one instant and then cease to

exist than to exist forever

and never be a part of beauty

our attitude toward life

is come easy go easy

we are like human beings

used to be before they became

too civilized to enjoy themselves



and before i could argue him

out of his philosophy

he went and immolated himself

on a patent cigar lighter

i do not agree with him

myself i would rather have

half the happiness and twice

the longevity



but at the same time i wish

there was something i wanted

as badly as he wanted to fry himself

archy





a roach of the taverns


i went into a

speakeasy the other night

with some of the

boys and we were all sitting

around under one of

the tables making

merry with crumbs and

cheese and what not but

after while a strange

melancholy descended

upon the jolly crew and

one old brown veteran roach

said with a sigh well

boys eat drink and

be maudlin for

tomorrow we are dry the

shadow of the padlock

rushes toward us

like a sahara sandstorm

flinging itself at an oasis

for years myself and my

ancestors before me have

inhabited yonder ice box but

the day approaches

when our old homestead

will be taken away from

here and scalded out

yes says i soon there will

be nothing but that

eheu fugaces stuff

on every hand i

never drank it says he

what kind of a

drink is it

it is bitter as wormwood

says i and the

only chaser to it is

the lethean water

it is not the booze itself

that i regret so

much said the old brown

roach it is the

golden companionship of

the tavern myself

and my ancestors have been

chop house and tavern

roaches for hundreds of years

countless generations back

one of my elizabethan

forbears was plucked from

a can of ale in the

mermaid tavern by

will shakespeare and

put down kit marlowe s back

what subtle wits they were in

those days said i yes

he said and later

another one of my

ancestors was

introduced into a larded

hare that addison

was eating by dicky steele

my ancestor came

skurrying forth dicky

said is that your own

hare joe or a wig a

thing which addison

never forgave yours is a

remarkable family

history i said yes he

said i am the last

of a memorable

line one of my

ancestors was found drowned

in the ink well

out of which poor

eddie poe wrote the

raven we have

always associated with wits

bohemians and bon

vivants my maternal

grandmother was slain by

john masefield with

a bung starter well well it

is sad i said the

glad days pass yes

he says soon we will all

be as dry as the

egyptian scarab that

lies in the sarcophagus

beside the mummy of rameses and

he hasn t had a

drink for four thousand

years it is sad for

you he continued but

think how much sadder it

is for me with

a family tradition such as

mine only one of my

ancestors cheese it i said

interrupting him i do

not wish to injure

your feelings but i weary

of your ancestors i

have often noticed that

ancestors never boast

of the descendants who boast

of ancestors i would

rather start a family than

finish one blood will tell but often

it tells too much

the froward lady bug


boss is it not awful

the way some female

creatures mistake ordinary

politeness for sudden

adoration

i met a katydid in a

beef stew in ann

street the other evening her

foot slipped and she

was about to sink

forever when i pushed her a

toothpick since i

rescued her the poor silly

thing follows me about

day and night i always felt

my fate would be a

poet she says to me how lovely

to be rescued by one i

am musical myself my

nature is sensitive to it so

much so that for

months i dwelt in a grand

piano in carnegie hall i

hope you don t think

i am bold no i said you

seem timid to me you

seem to lack courage entirely the

way you dog my footsteps

one would think you

were afraid to be alone i do

not wish any one any

ill luck but if

this shrinking thing got

caught in a high wind and

was blown out to

open sea i hope she would

be saved by a ship

outward bound for

madagascar

pete the parrot and shakespeare


i got acquainted with

a parrot named pete recently

who is an interesting bird

pete says he used

to belong to the fellow

that ran the mermaid tavern

in london then i said

you must have known

shakespeare know him said pete

poor mutt i knew him well

he called me pete and i called him

bill but why do you say poor mutt

well said pete bill was a

disappointed man and was always

boring his friends about what

he might have been and done

if he only had a fair break

two or three pints of sack

and sherris and the tears

would trickle down into his

beard and his beard would get

soppy and wilt his collar

i remember one night when

bill and ben jonson and

frankie beaumont

were sopping it up



here i am ben says bill

nothing but a lousy playwright

and with anything like luck

in the breaks i might have been

a fairly decent sonnet writer

i might have been a poet

if i had kept away from the theatre

yes says ben i ve often

thought of that bill

but one consolation is

you are making pretty good money

out of the theatre



money money says bill what the hell

is money what i want is to be

a poet not a business man

these damned cheap shows

i turn out to keep the

theatre running break my heart

slap stick comedies and

blood and thunder tragedies

and melodramas say i wonder

if that boy heard you order

another bottle frankie

the only compensation is that i get

a chance now and then

to stick in a little poetry

when nobody is looking

but hells bells that isn t

what i want to do

i want to write sonnets and

songs and spenserian stanzas

and i might have done it too

if i hadn t got

into this frightful show game

business business business

grind grind grind

what a life for a man

that might have been a poet



well says frankie beaumont

why don t you cut it bill

i can t says bill

i need the money i ve got

a family to support down in

the country well says frankie

anyhow you write pretty good

plays bill any mutt can write

plays for this london public

says bill if he puts enough

murder in them what they want

is kings talking like kings

never had sense enough to talk

and stabbings and stranglings

and fat men making love

and clowns basting each

other with clubs and cheap puns

and off color allusions to all

the smut of the day oh i know

what the low brows want

and i give it to them



well says ben jonson

don t blubber into the drink

brace up like a man

and quit the rotten business

i can t i can t says bill

i ve been at it too long i ve got to

the place now where i can t

write anything else

but this cheap stuff

i m ashamed to look an honest

young sonneteer in the face

i live a hell of a life i do

the manager hands me some mouldy old

manuscript and says

bill here s a plot for you

this is the third of the month

by the tenth i want a good

script out of this that we

can start rehearsals on

not too big a cast

and not too much of your

damned poetry either

you know your old

familiar line of hokum

they eat up that falstaff stuff

of yours ring him in again

and give them a good ghost

or two and remember we gotta

have something dick burbage can get

his teeth into and be sure

and stick in a speech

somewhere the queen will take

for a personal compliment and if

you get in a line or two somewhere

about the honest english yeoman

it s always good stuff

and it s a pretty good stunt

bill to have the heavy villain

a moor or a dago or a jew

or something like that and say

i want another

comic welshman in this

but i don t need to tell

you bill you know this game

just some of your ordinary

hokum and maybe you could

kill a little kid or two a prince

or something they like

a little pathos along with

the dirt now you better see burbage

tonight and see what he wants

in that part oh says bill

to think i am

debasing my talents with junk

like that oh god what i wanted

was to be a poet

and write sonnet serials

like a gentleman should



well says i pete

bill s plays are highly

esteemed to this day

is that so says pete

poor mutt little he would

care what poor bill wanted

was to be a poet

archy





horse shakespeare and i





archy confesses


coarse

jocosity

catches the crowd

shakespeare

and i

are often

low browed



the fish wife

curse

and the laugh

of the horse

shakespeare

and i

are frequently

coarse



aesthetic

excuses

in bill s behalf

are adduced

to refine

big bill s

coarse laugh



but bill

he would chuckle

to hear such guff

he pulled

rough stuff

and he liked

rough stuff



hoping you

are the same

archy





mehitabel he says—





the old trouper


i ran onto mehitabel again

last evening

she is inhabiting

a decayed trunk

which lies in an alley

in greenwich village

in company with the

most villainous tom cat

i have ever seen

but there is nothing

wrong about the association

archy she told me

it is merely a plutonic

attachment

and the thing can be

believed for the tom

looks like one of pluto s demons

it is a theatre trunk

archy mehitabel told me

and tom is an old theatre cat

he has given his life

to the theatre

he claims that richard

mansfield once

kicked him out of the way

and then cried because

he had done it and

petted him

and at another time

he says in a case

of emergency

he played a bloodhound

in a production of

uncle tom s cabin

the stage is not what it

used to be tom says

he puts his front paw

on his breast and says

they don t have it any more

they don t have it here

the old troupers are gone

there s nobody can troupe

any more

they are all amateurs nowadays

they haven t got it

here

there are only

five or six of us oldtime

troupers left

this generation does not know

what stage presence is

personality is what they lack

personality

where would they get

the training my old friends

got in the stock companies

i knew mr booth very well

says tom

and a law should be passed

preventing anybody else

from ever playing

in any play he ever

played in

there was a trouper for you

i used to sit on his knee

and purr when i was

a kitten he used to tell me

how much he valued my opinion

finish is what they lack

finish

and they haven t got it

here

and again he laid his paw

on his breast

i remember mr daly very

well too

i was with mr daly s company

for several years

there was art for you

there was team work

there was direction

they knew the theatre

and they all had it

here

for two years mr daly

would not ring up the curtain

unless i was in the

prompter s box

they are amateurs nowadays

rank amateurs all of them

for two seasons i played

the dog in joseph

jefferson s rip van winkle

it is true i never came

on the stage

but he knew i was just off

and it helped him

i would like to see

one of your modern

theatre cats

act a dog so well

that it would convince

a trouper like jo jefferson

but they haven t got it

nowadays

they haven t got it

here

jo jefferson had it he had it

here

i come of a long line

of theatre cats

my grandfather

was with forrest

he had it he was a real trouper

my grandfather said

he had a voice

that used to shake

the ferryboats

on the north river

once he lost his beard

and my grandfather

dropped from the

fly gallery and landed

under his chin

and played his beard

for the rest of the act

you don t see any theatre

cats that could do that

nowadays

they haven t got it they

haven t got it

here

once i played the owl

in modjeska s production

of macbeth

i sat above the castle gate

in the murder scene

and made my yellow

eyes shine through the dusk

like an owl s eyes

modjeska was a real

trouper she knew how to pick

her support i would like

to see any of these modern

theatre cats play the owl s eyes

to modjeska s lady macbeth

but they haven t got it nowadays

they haven t got it

here



mehitabel he says

both our professions

are being ruined

by amateurs

archy





archy declares war


i am going to start

a revolution

i saw a kitchen

worker killing

water bugs with poison

hunting pretty

little roaches

down to death

it set my blood to

boiling

i thought of all

the massacres and slaughter

of persecuted insects

at the hands of cruel humans

and i cried

aloud to heaven

and i knelt

on all six legs

and vowed a vow

of vengeance

i shall organize the insects

i shall drill them

i shall lead them

i shall fling a billion

times a billion billion

risen insects in an army

at the throats

of all you humans

unless you sign the papers

for a damn site better treatment

volunteers volunteers

hearken to my calling

fifty million flies

are wanted may the first

to die in marmalade

curses curses curses

on the cruel human race

does not the poor mosquito

love her little offspring

that you swat against the wall

out of equatorial

swamps and fever jungles

come o mosquitoes

a billion billion strong

and sting a billion baldheads

till they butt against each other

and break like egg shells

caterpillars locusts

grasshoppers gnats

vampire moths

black legged spiders

with red hearts of hell

centipedes and scorpions

little gingery ants

come come come

come you tarantulas

with fury in your feet

bloodsuckers wriggle

out of the bayous

ticks cooties hornets

give up your pleasures

all your little trivial

sunday school picnics

this is war

in earnest

and red revolution

come in a cloud

with a sun hiding miracle

of small deadly wings

swarm stab and bite

what we want is justice

curses curses curses

over land air and water

whirl in a million

sweeping and swaying

cyclonic dances

whirl high and swoop

down on the cities

like a comet bearing death

in the loop and flick

of its tail

little little creatures

out of all your billions

make great dragons

that lie along the sky

and war with the sunset

and eat up the moon

draw all the poison

from the evil stars

and spit it on the earth

remember every planet

pivots on an atom

and so you are strong

i swear by the great

horned toad of mithridates

i swear by the vision

of whiskered old pythagoras

that i am very angry

i am mad as hell

for i have seen a soapy

kitchen mechanic

murdering my brothers

slaying little roaches

pathetic in their innocence

damn her red elbows

damn her spotted apron

damn her steamy hair

damn her dull eyes

that look like a pair

of little pickled onions

curses curses curses

i even heard her praised

for undertaking murder

on her own volition

and called the only perfect

cook in the city

come come come

come in your billions

tiny small feet

and humming little wings

crawlers and creepers

wigglers and stingers

scratchers borers slitherers

little forked tongues

man is at your mercy

one sudden gesture

and all his empires perish

rise

strike for freedom

curses on the species

that invented roach poison

curses on the stingy

beings that evolved

tight zinc covers

that you can t crawl under

for their garbage cans

come like a sandstorm

spewed from the mouth

of a great apocalyptic

desert making devil

come like the spray

sooty and fiery

snorted from the nostrils

of a sky eating ogre

let us have a little

direct action is the

sincere wish of

archy





the hen and the oriole


well boss did it

ever strike you that a

hen regrets it just as

much when they wring her

neck as an oriole but

nobody has any

sympathy for a hen because

she is not beautiful

while every one gets

sentimental over the

oriole and says how

shocking to kill the

lovely thing this thought

comes to my mind

because of the earnest

endeavor of a

gentleman to squash me

yesterday afternoon when i

was riding up in the

elevator if i had been a

butterfly he would have

said how did that

beautiful thing happen to

find its way into

these grimy city streets do

not harm the splendid

creature but let it

fly back to its rural

haunts again beauty always

gets the best of

it be beautiful boss

a thing of beauty is a

joy forever

be handsome boss and let

who will be clever is

the sad advice

of your ugly little friend

archy





ghosts


you want to know

whether i believe in ghosts

of course i do not believe in them

if you had known

as many of them as i have

you would not

believe in them either

perhaps i have been

unfortunate in my acquaintance

but the ones i have known

have been a bad lot

no one could believe in them

after being acquainted with them

a short time

it is true that i have met

them under peculiar

circumstances

that is while they

were migrating into the

bodies of what human beings

consider a lower order

of creatures

before i became a cockroach

i was a free verse poet

one of the pioneers of the artless art

and my punishment for that

was to have my soul

enter the body of a cockroach

the ghosts i have known

were the ghosts of persons

who were waiting for a vacant

body to get into

they knew they were going

to transmigrate into the bodies of

lizards lice bats snakes

worms beetles mice alley cats

turtles snails tadpoles

etcetera

and while they were waiting

they were as cross as all get out

i remember talking to one of them

who had just worked his way

upward again he had been in the

body of a flea and he was going

into a cat fish

you would think he might be

grateful for the promotion

but not he

i do not call this much of an advance

he said why could i not

be a humming bird or something

kid i told him it will

take you a million years to work your

way up to a humming bird

when i remember he said

that i used to be a hat check boy

in a hotel i could

spend a million years weeping

to think that i should come to this

we have all seen better days i said

we have all come down in the world

you have not come down as far

as some of us

if i ever get to be a hat check boy

again he said i will sting

somebody for what i have had to suffer

that remark will probably cost you

another million years among

the lower creatures i told him

transmigration is a great thing

if you do not weaken

personally my ambition is to get

my time as a cockroach shortened for

good behavior and be promoted

to a revenue officer

it is not much of a step up but

i am humble

i never ran across any of this

ectoplasm that sir arthur

conan doyle tells of but it sounds

as if it might be wonderful

stuff to mend broken furniture with

archy





archy hears from mars


at eleven o clock

p m on last saturday evening

i received the following

message on my

own private radio set

good evening little archibald

and how are you

this is mars speaking

i replied at once

whom or who

as the case may be

do i know on mars

every one here is familiar

with your work archy

was the answer

and we feel well repaid

for all the trouble we have had

in getting in touch

with your planet

thank you i replied

i would rather hear

mars say that

than any other planet

mars has always been

one of my favorite planets

it is sweet of you

to think that way about us

said mars

and so we continued to pay

each other interstellar

compliments

what is or are

thirty five million miles

between kindred souls

tell us all about

your planet said mars

well i said it is

round like an orange

or a ball

and it is all cluttered

up with automobiles

and politicians

it doesn t know where it is

going nor why

but it is in a hurry

it is in charge of a

two legged animal called

man who is genuinely

puzzled as to whether

his grandfather was a god

or a monkey

i should think said mars

that what he is himself

would make more difference

than what his grandfather was

not to this animal i replied

he is the great alibi ike of

the cosmos when he raises hell

just because he feels like

raising hell

he wants somebody to blame it on

can t anything be done about him

said mars

i am doing the best i can

i answered

but after all i am only one

and my influence is limited

you are too modest archy

said mars

we all but worship you

here on this planet

a prophet said i is not

without honor save on his own

planet wait a minute

said mars

i want to write that down

that is one of your best things

archy is it original

it was once i answered truthfully

and may be again

won t you tell us a little

something said mars

about yourself what you look like

and what you think

is the best thing you have written

and your favorite games

and that sort of thing

well i said i am brunette

and stand over six feet

without any shoes on

the best skits i have done

were some little plays

i dashed off

under the general title

of shakespeare s plays

and my favorite sport is theology

you must meet

a great many interesting people

said mars

oh yes i said one becomes

accustomed to that after a while

what is your favorite dish

said mars and do you believe

in the immortality of the soul

stew i said and yes

at least mine is immortal

but i could name several others

that i have my doubts about

is there anything else

of interest about your planet

which you wish to tell your

many admirers on mars

asked mars

there is very little else

of any real interest i said

and now will you tune out

and let me do some work

you people who say you admire

my work are always butting in

and taking up my time

how the hell can i get any

serious literary work done

if you keep bothering me

all the time now you get off

the ether and let me do some

deep thinking

you might add that i am shy

and loathe publicity

she was out in the alley

dancing on the cold cobbles

while the wild december wind

blew through her frozen whiskers

and as she danced

she wailed and sang to herself

uttering the fragments

that rattled in her cold brain

in part as follows



whirl mehitabel whirl

the dissipated hornet


well boss i had a

great example of the corrupting

influence of the great

city brought to my notice recently a

drunken hornet blew in here

the other day and sat down in the

corner and dozed and buzzed not a

real sleep you know one of those wakeful

liquor trances with the

fuzzy talk oozing out of it to hear

this guy mumble in his dreams he was right

wicked my name he says is crusty bill

i never been licked and i never will and

then he would go half way asleep

again nobody around here wanted to

fight him and after a while he got

sober enough to know how drunk he had

been and began to cry over it and get

sentimental about himself mine is a wasted

life he says but i had a good

start red liquor ruined me he says and

sobbed tell me your story i

said two years ago he said i was a country

hornet young and strong and handsome i

lived in a rusty rainspout with my

parents and brothers and sisters and all was

innocent and merry often in that happy

pastoral life would we swoop down

with joyous laughter and sting the school

children on the village green but on an evil

day alas i came to the city in a crate

of peaches i found myself in a market

near the water front alone and friendless in the

great city its ways were strange to

me food seemed inaccessible i thought

that i might starve to death as i was buzzing

down the street thinking these gloomy

thoughts i met another hornet

just outside a speak easy kid he says

you look down in the mouth forget

it kid i will show you how to live without

working how i says watch me he says just

then a drunken fly came crawling out

of the bar room in a leisurely way my new

found friend stung dissected and consumed that fly

that s the way he says smacking his lips

this is the life that was a beer fly

wait and i will get you a cocktail fly this

is the life i took up that life alas the

flies around a bar room get so drunk drinking

what is spilled that they are helpless all a

hornet has to do is wait calmly until

they come staggering out and there is his

living ready made for him at first being

young and innocent i ate only beer flies but

the curse of drink got me the mad life began

to tell upon me i got so i would not eat a

fly that was not full of some strong and heady

liquor the lights and life got me i would

not eat fruits and vegetables any more i scorned

flies from a soda fountain

they seemed flat and insipid to me

finally i got so wicked that i

went back to the country and got six innocent

young hornets and brought them back

to the city with me i started them in the

business i debauched them and

they caught my flies for me now i am in

an awful situation my six hornets from the

country have struck and set up on their own

hook i have to catch my flies myself

and my months of idleness and

dissipation have spoiled my technique i

can t catch a fly now unless he is dead drunk

what is to become of me alas the curse

of alcoholic beverages especially with each

meal well i said it is a sad story

bill and of a sort only too

common in this day of ours it is he says i

have the gout in my stinger so bad

that i scream with pain every time i spear

a fly i got into a safe place on the

inside of the typewriter and yelled out at him

my advice is suicide bill all the time

he had been pitying himself my sympathy had

been with the flies

archy





unjust


poets are always asking

where do the little roses go

underneath the snow

but no one ever thinks to say

where do the little insects stay

this is because

as a general rule

roses are more handsome

than insects

beauty gets the best of it

in this world

i have heard people

say how wicked it was

to kill our feathered

friends

in order to get

their plumage and pinions

for the hats of women

and all the while

these same people

might be eating duck

as they talked

the chances are

that it is just as discouraging

to a duck to have

her head amputated

in order to become

a stuffed roast fowl

and decorate a dining table

as it is for a bird

of gayer plumage

to be bumped

off the running board of existence

to furnish plumage

for a lady s hat

but the duck

does not get the sympathy

because the duck

is not beautiful

the only insect

that succeeds in getting

mourned is a moth

or butterfly

whereas every man s

heel is raised against

the spider

and it is getting harder

and harder for spiders

to make an honest living

at that since

human beings have invented

so many ways

of killing flies

humanity will shed poems

full of tears

over the demise of

a bounding doe

or a young gazelle

but the departure of a trusty

camel leaves the

vast majorities

stonily indifferent

perhaps the theory is

that god would not have made

the camel so ugly

if the camel were not wicked

alas exclamation point

the pathos of ugliness

is only perceived

by us cockroaches of the world

and personally

i am having to stand for a lot

i am getting it double

as you might say

before my soul

migrated into the body

of a cockroach

it inhabited the carcase

of a vers libre poet

some vers libre poets are beautiful

but i was not

i had a little blond mustache

that every one thought was a mistake

and yet since i have died

i have thought of that

with regret

it hung over a mouth

that i found it difficult to keep closed

because of adenoidal trouble

but it would have been better

if i could have kept it closed

because the teeth within

were out of alignment

and were of odd sizes

this destroyed my acoustics

as you might say

my chin was nothing much

and knew it

and timidly shrank

into itself

receding from the battle of life

my eyes were all right

but my eyebrows

were scarcely noticeable

i suppose though that if

i had had noticeable eyebrows

they would have been wrong

somehow

well well not to pursue

this painful subject

to the uttermost and ultimate

wart and freckle

i was not handsome and it hampered

me when i was a human

it militated against me

as a poet

more beautiful creatures could

write verse worse than mine

and get up and recite it

with a triumphant air

and get away with it

but my sublimest ideas

were thought to be a total

loss when people saw

where they came from

i think it would have been

only justice

if i had been sent to inhabit

a butterfly

but there is very little

justice in the universe

what is the use

of being the universe

if you have to be just

interrogation point

and i suppose the universe

has so much really important

business on hand

that it finds it impossible

to look after the details

it is rushed

perhaps it has private

knowledge to the effect

that eternity is brief

after all

and it wants to get the big

jobs finished in a hurry

i find it possible to forgive

the universe

i meet it in a give and take spirit

although i do wish

that it would consult me at times

please forgive

the profundity of these

meditations

whenever i have nothing

particular to say

i find myself always

always plunging into cosmic

philosophy

or something

archy





the cheerful cricket


i can t see for the

life of me what there is

about crickets that makes people

call them jolly they

are the parrots of the insect race

crying cheer up cheer up

cheer up over and

over again till you want to

swat them i hate one of these

grinning skipping smirking

senseless optimists worse

than i do a cynic or a

pessimist there was

one in here the other day i was

feeling pretty well

and pleased with the world when

he started that confounded

cheer up cheer up cheer up stuff

fellow i said i am

cheerful enough or i was till

a minute ago but you

get on my nerves it s all right

to be bright and merry

but what s the use

pretending you have more

cheerfulness than there is in the

world you sound

insincere to me you insist on

it too much you make

me want to sit in

a tomb and listen to the

screech owls telling

ghost stories to the tree toads i

would rather that i heard a door squeak have

you only one record the sun

shone in my soul today before

you came and you

have made me think of the

world s woe groan

once or i will go mad your

voice floats around the world like

the ghost of a man

who laughed himself to death

listening to funny stories

the boss told i listen to you

and know why shakespeare

killed off mercutio so

early in the play it is only

hamlet that can

find material for five acts

cheer up cheer up cheer up he

says bo i told him i

wish i was the

woolworth tower i would fall

on you cheer up cheer up cheer

up he says again

all a spook has to do is stick around





clarence the ghost


the longer i live the more i

realize that everything is

relative even morality is

relative things you would not do

sometimes you would do other

times for instance i would not consider

it honorable in me as a

righteous cockroach to crawl into a

near sighted man s soup that

man would not have a sporting chance but

with a man with ordinarily good eye

sight i should say it was

up to him to watch his soup himself and

yet if i was very tired and hungry

i would crawl into even a near

sighted man s soup knowing all the

time it was wrong and my necessity would

keep me from reproaching myself too

bitterly afterwards you can

not make any hard and fast rule

concerning the morality of crawling into

soup nor anything else a certain

alloy of expediency improves the

gold of morality and makes

it wear all the longer consider a

ghost if i were a ghost i

would not haunt ordinary people but i

would have all the fun i wanted to with

spiritualists for spiritualists are

awful nuisances to ghosts i knew a

ghost by the name of clarence one

time who hated spiritualists with a

great hatred you see said clarence they

give me no rest they have got my

number once one of those psychics gets a

ghost s number so he has to come

when he is called they work him till

the astral sweat stands out in beads

on his spectral brow they seem to think

said clarence that all a spook has to do

is to stick around waiting to dash in

with a message as to whether mrs millionbucks

pet pom has pneumonia or only wheezes

because he has been eating too many

squabs clarence was quite

bitter about it but wait he says till

the fat medium with the red nose

that has my number

passes over and i can get my

clutches on him on equal terms there s

going to be some initiation beside

the styx several of the boys are

sore on him a plump chance i have

don t i to improve myself and pass on

to another star with that medium

yanking me into somebody s parlor to

blow through one of these little tin

trumpets any time of the day or night

honest archy he says i hate the sight of a

ouija board would it be moral he

says to give that goof a bum tip on the

stock market life ain t worth

dying he says if you ve got to fag

for some chinless chump of a psychic

nor death ain t worth living

through would it be moral in me to

queer that simp with his

little circle by saying he s got an

anonymous diamond brooch in his pocket

and that his trances are rapidly developing

his kleptomania no clarence i said it

wouldn t be moral but it

might be expedient there s a ghost

around here i have been trying to get

acquainted with but he is shy i think he is

probably afraid of cockroaches

prudence


i do not think a prudent one

will ever aim too high

a cockroach seldom whips a dog

and seldom should he try



and should a locust take a vow

to eat a pyramid

he likely would wear out his teeth

before he ever did



l do not think the prudent one

hastes to initiate

a sequence of events which he

lacks power to terminate



for should i kick the woolworth tower

so hard i laid it low

it probably might injure me

if it fell on my toe



i do not think the prudent one

will be inclined to boast

lest circumstances unforeseen

should get him goat and ghost



for should i tell my friends i d drink

the hudson river dry

a tidal wave might come and turn

my statements to a lie

this morning—





archy goes abroad


london england

since i have been

residing in westminster

abbey i have learned

a secret that i desire

to pass on to the psychic

sharps it is this

until the body of a human

being perishes utterly

the spirit is not

released from its vicinity

so long as there is any

form left in the physical

part of it the ghost can not go

to heaven or to hell

the ancient greeks

understood this and they

burned the body very often

so that the spirit could

get immediate release

the ancient egyptians

also knew it

but they reacted differently

to the knowledge

they embalmed the body

so that the form would

persist for thousands

of years and the ghost would have

to stick around for a time

here in westminster abbey

there are hundreds of

ghosts that have not yet

been released

some of them are able to wander

a few miles away

and some of them cannot

go further than a few hundred

yards from the graves

where the bodies lie

for the most part they make

the best of it

they go out on little

excursions around london

and at night they sit on

their tombs and

tell their experiences

to each other

it is perhaps the most

exclusive club in london

henry the eighth came in

about three oclock this morning

after rambling about

piccadilly for a couple of hours

between him and charles dickens

a ghost can so influence

a living person that you

might say he had grabbed off

that living person s body and was

using it as his own

edward the black prince

was telling the gang

the other evening

that he had been leading the life

of a city clerk for three weeks

one of those birds

with a top hat and a sack coat

who come floating through

the mist and drizzle

with manuscript cases

under their arms looking unreal

even when they are not animated

by ghosts edward the black prince

who is known democratically

as neddie black here

says this clerk was a mild and

humble wight when he took

him over but he worked

him up to the place where

he assaulted a policeman

Saturday night then left him flat

one of the most pathetic

sights however

is to see the ghost of queen

victoria going out every

evening with the ghost

of a sceptre in her hand

to find mr lytton strachey

and bean him it seems she beam.

him and beans him and he

never knows it

and every night on the stroke

of midnight elizabeth tudor

is married to waiter raleigh by that

eminent clergyman

dr lawrence sterne

the gang pulls a good many

pageants which are written

by ben jonson but i think

the jinks will not be properly

planned and staged until

j m barrie gets here

this is the jolliest bunch

i have met in london

they have learned

since they passed over

that appearances and suety

pudding are not all they were

cracked up to be more anon from your little friend

archy





archy at the tomb of napoleon


paris france

i went over to

the hotel des invalides

today and gazed on

the sarcophagus of the

great napoleon

and the thought came

to me as i looked

down indeed it

is true napoleon

that the best goods

come in the smallest

packages here are

you napoleon with

your glorious course

run and here is

archy just in the

prime of his career

with his greatest

triumphs still before

him neither one of us

had a happy youth

neither one of us

was welcomed socially at

the beginning of his

career neither one of

us was considered much

to look at

and in ten thousand years from

now perhaps what you said and did

napoleon will be

confused with what

archy said and did

and perhaps the burial

place of neither will be

known napoleon looking

down upon you

i wish to ask you now

frankly as one famous

person to another

has it been worth

all the energy

that we expended all the

toil and trouble and

turmoil that it cost us

if you had your life

to live over

again bonaparte would

you pursue the star

of ambition

i tell you frankly

bonaparte that i myself

would choose the

humbler part

i would put the temptation

of greatness aside

and remain an ordinary

cockroach simple

and obscure but alas

there is a destiny that

pushes one forward

no matter how hard

one may try to resist it

i do not need to

tell you about that

bonaparte you know as

much about it as i do

yes looking at it in

the broader way neither

one of us has been to blame

for what he has done

neither for his great

successes nor his great mistakes

both of us napoleon

were impelled by some

mighty force external to

ourselves we are both to

be judged as great forces of

nature as tools in the

hand of fate rather than as

individuals who willed to

do what we have done

we must be forgiven

napoleon

you and i

when we have been

different from the common

run of creatures

i forgive you as i know

that you would forgive

me could you speak to me

and if you and i

napoleon forgive and

understand each other

what matters it if all

the world else find

things in both of us that

they find it hard

to forgive and understand

we have been

what we have been

napoleon and let them laugh that off

well after an hour or so of

meditation there i left

actually feeling that i

had been in communion

with that great spirit and

that for once in my

life i had understood and been

understood

and i went away feeling

solemn but likewise

uplifted mehitabel the

cat is missing

archy





mehitabel meets an affinity


paris france

mehitabel the cat

has been passing her

time in the dubious

company of

a ragged eared tom cat

with one mean

eye and the other

eye missing whom

she calls francy

he has been the hero

or the victim of

many desperate encounters

for part of his tail

has been removed

and his back has been chewed

to the spine

one can see at a glance

that he is a sneak thief

and an apache

a bandit with long

curved claws

you see his likes hanging

about the outdoor markets

here in paris waiting

their chance to sneak

a fish or a bit

of unregarded meat

or whimpering

among the chair legs at the

sidewalk cafes in the

evenings or slinking

down the gutters of

alleys in the old

quarters of the town

he has a raucous voice

much damaged by the night

air and yet there is a

sentimental wheedling

note in it as well

and yet withal he carries

his visible disgrace with

a jaunty air

when i asked mehitabel

where in the name of st denis

did you pick up that

romantic criminal

in the luxembourg gardens

she replied where

we had both gone to kill

birds he has been showing me

paris he does not

understand english but speak of

him with respect

he is like myself

an example of the truth

of the pythagorean idea

you know that in my body

which is that of a cat

there is reincarnated

the soul of cleopatra

well this cat here

was not always a cat either

he has seen better days

he tells me that once he was

a bard and lived here in paris

tell archy here

something about yourself francy

thus encouraged the

murderous looking animal spoke

and i append a

rough translation of

what he said



tame cats on a web of the persian woof

may lick their coats and purr for cream

but i am a tougher kind of goof

scheming a freer kind of scheme

daily i climb where the pigeons gleam

over the gargoyles of notre dame

robbing their nests to hear them scream

for i am a cat of the devil i am



i ll tell the world i m a hard boiled oeuf

i rend the clouds when i let off steam

to the orderly life i cry pouf pouf

it is worth far less than the bourgeois deem

my life is a dance on the edge de l abime

and i am the singer you d love to slam

who murders the midnight anonyme

for i am a cat of the devil i am



when the ribald moon leers over the roof

and the mist reeks up from the chuckling stream

i pad the quais on a silent hoof

dreaming the vagabond s ancient dream

where the piebald toms of the quartier teem

and fight for a fish or a mouldy clam

my rival i rip and his guts unseam

for i am a cat of the devil i am

roach i could rattle you rhymes by the ream

in proof of the fact that i m no spring lamb

maybe the headsman will finish the theme

for i am a cat of the devil i am

mehitabel i said

your friend is nobody else

than francois villon

and he looks it too

archy





mehitabel sees paris


paris france

i have not been

to geneva but i have been

talking to a french cockroach

who has just returned

from there traveling all the

way in a third class

compartment he says there is no

hope for insect or man in

the league of nations

what prestige it ever had is gone

and it never had any

the idea of one great brotherhood

of men and insects on earth

is very attractive to me

but mehitabel the cat

says i am a communist an

anarchist and a socialist

she has been shocked to the soul

she says by what the

revolutionists did here during

the revolution

i am always the aristocrat archy

she said i may go and play

around montmartre and that sort

of thing and in fact i was

playing up there with francy last

night but i am always the lady

in spite of my little larks

toujours gai archy and toujours

the lady that is my motto in

spite of

ups and downs

what they did to us aristocrats

at the time of the revolution

was a plenty archy

it makes my heart bleed

to see signs of it all

over town those poor

dear duchesses that got it

in the neck i can sympathize

with them archy i may not

look it now but i come of a

royal race myself

i have come down in the world

but wotthehell archy wotthehell

jamais triste archy jamais triste

that is my motto

always the lady and always

out for a good time

francy and i lapped up

a demi of beer in a joint

up on the butte last night

that an american tourist

poured out for us

and everybody laughed and it

got to be the fashion up there

to feed beer to us cats

i did not get a vulgar souse

archy no lady gets a vulgar

souse wotthehell i hope i am above

all vulgarity but i did get a

little bit lit up

and francy did too we came

down and got on top of the

new morgue and sang and did

dances there

francy seems to see

something attractive about

morgues when he gets lit up

the old morgue he says was

a more romantic morgue but

vandal hands have tom it down

but wotthehell archy this one

will do to dance on

francy is showing me a side

paris he says tourists don t often

get a look at he has a little

love nest down in the

catacombs where

he and i are living now

he and i go down there

and do the tango amongst the

bones he is really a most

entertaining and agreeable

companion archy and he has some

very quaint ideas he is busy now

writing a poem about

us two cats filled with beer

dancing among the bones

sometimes i think francy

is a little morbid

when i see these lovely old places

that us aristocrats built archy

in the hands of the bourgeois it

makes me almost wild

but i try to bear up i try

to bear up i find agreeable

companions and put a good face

on it toujours gai that is my

motto toujours gai

francy is a little bit done up

today he tried to steal a

partridge out of a frying

pan in a joint up on the butte

we went back there for more beer

after our party

at the morgue

and the cook beaned him with

a bottle poor francy i

should hate to lose him

but something tells me i should

not stay a widow long

there is something in the air

of paris archy

that makes one young again

there s more than one

dance in the old dame yet

and with these words she

put her tail in the air and

capered off down the alley

i am afraid we shall never

get mehitabel back to america

archy





mehitabel in the catacombs


paris france

i would

fear greatly for the morals

of mehitabel the cat if she had any

the kind of life she

is leading is too violent

and undisciplined for words

she and the disreputable

tom cat who claims to have

been francois villon

when he was on earth

before have taken up their

permanent abode in the catacombs

whence they sally

forth nightly on excursions

of the most undignified nature

sometimes they honor

with their presence the cafes

of montparnasse and the boul mich

and sometimes they

seek diversion in the cabarets

on top of the butte

of montmartre

in these localities

it has become the fashion

among the humans

to feed beer to these

peculiar cats and they dance

and caper when they have

become well alcoholized

with this beverage

swinging their tails and

indulging in raucous feline

cries which they evidently

mistake for a song

it was my dubious

privilege to see them

when they returned to their

abode early yesterday morning

flushed as you might say

with bocks and still

in a holiday mood

the catacombs of paris are

not lined with the bones

of saints and martyrs

as are those of rome

but nevertheless these cats

should have more respect

for the relics of mortality

you may not believe me

but they actually danced and

capered among

the skeletons while the cat

who calls himself

francois villon gave forth

a chant of which the following

is a free translation



outcast bones from a thousand biers

click us a measure giddy and gleg

and caper my children dance my dears

skeleton rattle your mouldy leg

this one was a gourmet round as a keg

and that had the brow of semiramis

o fleshless forehead bald as an egg

all men s lovers come to this

this eyeless head that laughs and leers

was a chass daf once or a touareg

with golden rings in his yellow ears

skeleton rattle your mouldy leg

marot was this one or wilde or a wegg

who dropped into verses and down the abyss

and those are the bones of my old love meg

all men s lovers come to this



these bones were a ballet girl s for years

parbleu but she shook a wicked peg

and those ribs there were a noble peer s

skeleton rattle your mouldy leg

and here is a duchess that loved a yegg

with her lipless mouth that once drank bliss

down to the dreg of its ultimate dreg

all men s lovers come to this



prince if you pipe and plead and beg

you may yet be crowned with a grisly kiss

skeleton rattle your mouldy leg

all men s lovers come to this

archy





off with the old love


paris france

i think

mehitabel the cat and the

outcast feline

who calls himself francois

villon are about to

quarrel and separate

mehitabel is getting tired

of living in the catacombs

she said to me

last evening

archy i sometimes wish

that francy’s gaiety

did not so frequently take

a necrological turn

when francy is really happy

he always breaks

into a series of

lyric epitaphs

personally archy

i am a lady who can

be gay outside of

a mausoleum

as for morgues

and cemeteries i can

take them or i can

leave them alone

just because some of my

ancestors are now mummies

i do not feel

that i have to wait

till i see a sarcophagus

before i cheer up

i can fall in love

with a gentleman friend without

speculating how he is going

to look to the undertaker

and when i want to sing

a comic song

i do not always feel

impelled to hunt up a tomb

for a stage

i am a lady of refinement

archy i have had my ups

and downs and i have made

a few false steps in life

but i am toujours la grande dame

archy always the lady

old kid to hell with anything

coarse or unrefined

that has always been my motto

and the truth is that this

francy person has a yellow

streak of commonness

running through his poetic nature

i fell for him archy

but i feel there is trouble

coming we had words last

night over something no real

gentleman would have noticed

and the slob said to me

mehitabel if you make eyes again

at that tortoise shell

cat over there i will slice

your eyes out

with a single sweep of my claws

and toss them to the pigeons

archy those are words

that no gentleman would use

or no lady would take

you piebald fish thief

i told him

if i were not too refined

i would rip you

from the gullet to the mid riff

it is lucky for you

you frog eating four flush

that i always remember

my breeding

otherwise you would be

a candidate for what they call

civet stew in paris

something i won’t stand for in a

gentleman friend

is jealousy of every other

person who may be attracted to me

by my gaiety and

aristocratic manner

and if i hear another word

out of you

i will can you first

and kill you afterwards

and then i will ignore you

archy a gentleman

with any real spirit

would have swung on me

when i said that

but this quitter let me

get away with it

i clawed him a little archy

just to show him i could

and the goof stood for it

no cat can hold me archy

that lets me claw him without

a come back i am a strong free

spirit and i live my own

life and only a masterful

cave cat can hold my affections

he must be a gentleman

but he must also make me feel

that he could be a

wild cat if he would

this francy person is neither

one nor the other

ah me archy i am afraid

my little romance

is drawing to a close

and no meal ticket in sight

either but what the hell archy

a lady can always find friends

it won’t be the first time

i have been alone in the world

toujours gai archy

that is my motto

there’s more than one dance

in the old dame yet

archy





archy s life of mehitabel





the life of mehitabel the cat


boss i am engaged on a literary

work of some importance it is

nothing more nor less

than the life story of

mehitabel the cat she is

dictating it a word

at a time and all

she bunch gather around to listen but

i am rewriting it as i go along

boss i wish we

could do something

for mehitabel she is

a cat that has seen

better days she has

drunk cream at fourteen

cents the half pint

in her time and now she

is thankful for a

stray fish head from a

garbage cart but she is

cheerful under it all toujours

gai is ever her word

toujours gai kiddo drink she

says played a great

part in it all she

was taught to drink

beer by a kitchen maid she

trusted and was

abducted from a luxurious home

on one occasion in a

taxicab while under

the influence of beer which

she feels certain had been

drugged but still her

word is toujours gai my

kiddo toujours gai wotto hell

luck may change

archy





when along came my father bold





the minstrel and the maltese cross


well boss i promised to tell you

something of the life story of

mehitabel the cat archy says she i

was a beautiful kitten and as good

and innocent as i was beautiful my

mother was an angora you dont

look angora i said your fur

should show it did

i say angora said mehitabel it must

have been a slip of the tongue my

mother was high born and of

ancient lineage part persian and part

maltese a sort of maltese cross

i said archy she said please

do not josh my mother i

cannot permit levity in connection

with that saintly name she knew many

troubles did my mother and

died at last in a slum far from

all who had known her in her better

days but alas my father

was a villain he too had noble blood

but he had fallen into dissolute

ways and wandered the

alleys as the leader of a troupe of

strolling minstrels stealing milk

from bottles in the early mornings

catching rats here there and

everywhere and only too frequently

driven to the expedient of dining on

what might be found in

garbage cans and suburban

dump heaps now and

then a sparrow or a robin fell to my

fathers lot for he was a mighty hunter i

have heard that at times he even

ate cockroaches and as she said

that she spread

her claws and looked at me with her

head on one side i got into the works

of the typewriter mehitabel i

said try and conquer that wild and

hobohemian strain in your blood archy

she said have no fear i have dined

today but to resume my

mother the pampered beauty that she

was was eating whipped cream one

day on the back

stoop of the palace where she resided

when along came my father bold

black handsome villain that he was and

serenaded her his must have been a

magnetic personality for in spite of

her maiden modesty and

cloistered upbringing she responded

with a few well rendered musical

notes of her own i

will not dwell upon the wooing suffice

it to say that ere long they

not only sang duets together but

she was persuaded to join

him and his troupe of strollers in

their midnight meanderings alas that

first false step she

finally left her luxurious home it was

on a moonlight night in may i have

often heard her say and again and

again she has said to me that she

wished that robert w chambers could



have written her story or maybe john

galsworthy in his later and

more cosmopolitan manner well to

resume i was born in a stable in

greenwich village which was at

the time undergoing transformation

into a studio my

brothers and sisters were drowned

dearie i often look back on my life and

think how romantic it has all

been and wonder what fate saved

me and sent my brothers and sisters

to their watery grave archy i

have had a remarkable life go

on telling about it i said never

mind the side remarks i became

a pet at once continued

mehitabel but let us not make the first

instalment too long the

tale of my youth will be reserved

for your next chapter to be continued

archy





we could muzzle the child





mehitabel s first mistake


well i said to

mehitabel the cat continue

the story of your life i

was a pampered kitten for

a time archy she said but

alas i soon

realized that my master and

mistress were becoming

more and more fond of a

dog that lived with

them in the studio he was

an ugly mutt take it from

mc archy a red eyed little bull

dog with no manners i

hope i was too much of a lady

to show jealousy i have

been through a great deal

dearie now up and now down

but it is darn seldom

i ever forget i was a

lady always genteel archy

but this red eyed mutt was

certainly some pill and those

people were so stuck on

him that it would have made

you sick they called him

snookums and it was snookums

this and snookums that and

ribbons and bells and porterhouse

steak for him and if he

got a flea on him they called a

specialist in only one

day archy i hear my

mistress say snookums ookums

is lonely he ought to

have some one to play with

true said her husband every

dog should be brought up along

with a baby a dog

naturally likes a child to

play with we will have no

children said she a

vulgar foolish little child

might harm my snookums we

could muzzle the child said

her husband i am sure

the dog would like one to

play with and they

finally decided they would get

one from a foundling home

to play with snookums if

they could find a child

with a good enough pedigree

that wouldnt give any

germs to the dog well

one day the low lived mutt

butted in and tried to

swipe the cream i was drinking even

as a kitten archy i

never let any one put anything

across on me although i

am slow in starting

things as any real lady

should be dearie i let

this stiff snookums get

his face into the saucer

and then what i did

to his eyes and nose with

my claws would melt the

heart of a trained

nurse the simp had no

nerve he ran to his

mistress and she came after

me with a broom i

got three good scratches

through her silk stockings

archy dearie before i

was batted into the

alley and i picked myself

up out of a can full

of ashes a cat without a

home a poor little

innocent kitten alone

all alone in the great and

wicked city but i never

was one to be down

on my luck long archy my

motto has always been

toujours gai archy toujours

gai always jolly archy

always game and thank god

always the lady i

wandered a block or

two and strayed into

the family entrance of

a barroom it was my

first mistake mehitabels

adventures will be continued

archy





men shrank back from me





the curse of drink


to continue the story

of mehitabel the cat

she says to me when i

walked into that

barroom i was hungry and

mewing with despair

there were two men sitting

at the table and

looking sad i rubbed

against the legs of one

of them but he never moved

then i jumped up on

the table and stood

between them they both stared

hard at me and

then they stared at each

other but neither one

touched me or said anything

in front of one of

them was a glass full

of some liquid with

foam on the top of it i

thought it was milk

and began to drink from the

glass little did i

know archy as i lapped

it up that it was beer the

men shrank back from me and

began to tremble and shake

and look at me

finally one of them said to

the other i know what you

think bill what do i

think jeff said the

other you think bill that

i have the d ts said the

first one you think i

think i see a cat drinking

out of that beer glass but

i do not think i

see a cat at all that is all

in your imagination it

is you yourself that

have the d ts no said the

other one i dont think

you think you see a

cat i was not thinking

about cats at all i

do not know why you mention

cats for there are no

cats here just then a

salvation army lassie came

in and said you

wicked men teaching that poor

little innocent cat to

drink beer what cat

said one of the men she

thinks she sees a cat

said the other and

laughed and laughed

just then a mouse ran

across the floor and i

chased it and the salvation

lassie jumped on a

chair and screamed jeff

said bill i suppose now you

think i saw a

mouse i wish bill you

would change the

subject from animals said

jeff there is nothing

to be gained by talking

of animals mehitabel s

life story will be

continued in an early number

archy





a mouse ran across the floor



one day i left the place





pussy café


for some weeks said

mehitabel the cat continuing the

story of her life i

lived in that barroom and

though the society was

not what i had

been used to yet i

cannot say that it was

not interesting three

times a day in

addition to scraps from

the free lunch

and an occasional mouse

i was given a saucer

full of beer sometimes i

was given more and

when i was feeling

frolicsome it was the custom

for the patrons to gather

round and watch me

chase my tail until

i would suddenly fall

asleep at that time

they gave me the

nickname of pussy café but

one day i left the

place in the pocket

of a big fur

overcoat worn by

a gentleman who was

carrying so much that i thought

a little extra burden would

not be noticed he got

into a taxi cab

which soon afterwards

pulled up in front of

a swell residence uptown

and wandered up the

steps well said his

wife meeting him in the

hallway you are here

at last but where is my

mother whom i sent you to

the train to meet

could this be she asked

the ladys husband

pulling me out of his

coat pocket by the neck and

holding me up with a

dazed expression on his face

it could not said his

wife with a look of

scorn mehitabels life

story will be continued

before long

archy





a communication from archy


well boss i am

sorry to report that

mehitabel the cat has

struck no more story archy

money in the movies the

best bits are to

she says has been a

romantic one boss she has

the nerve to hold out

for a pint of

cream a day i am sick

of milk she says and

why should a lady author

drink ordinary milk cream

for mine she says

and no white of egg beaten

up on top of it either i

know what my dope

is worth boss it is

my opinion she has the

swell head over getting into

print i would hate

to stop the serial

but she needs a

lesson listen archy she said

to me what i want

with my stuff is

illustrations too the next

chapter is about me taking

my first false step well

archy i either get an

illustration for that or else

i sign up with these

movie people who are always

after me you will be

wanting to sing into a phonograph

next i told her

my advice is to

can her at once i will fill

the space with my own

adventures

archy





rganizing the ants the worms the wasps the bees for a revolt against mankind





the return of archy


where have i been so long

you ask me

i have been going up

and down like the devil

seeking what i might devour

i am hungry always hungry

and in the end i shall

eat everything

all the world shall come at

last to the multitudinous maws

of insects

a civilization perishes

before the tireless teeth

of little little germs

ha ha i have thrown off the mask

at last

you thought i was only

an archy

but i am more than that

i am anarchy

where have i been you ask

i have been organizing the insects

the ants the worms the wasps

the bees the cockroaches

the mosquitoes

for a revolt against mankind

i have declared war

upon humanity

i even i shall fling

the mighty atom

that splits a planet asunder

i ride the microbe

that crashes down olympus

where have i been you ask me where

i am jove and from my seat

on the edge of a bowl of beef stew

i launch the thunderous

molecule

that smites a cosmos into bits

where have i been you ask

but you had better ask

who follows in my train

there is an ant

a desert ant a tamerlane

who ate a pyramid in rage

that he might get at and devour

the mummies of six hundred

kings who in remote

antiquity had stepped upon

and crushed ascendants of his

my myrmidons

are trivial things

and they have always ruled

the world

and now they shall strike down mankind

i shall show you how

a solar system

pivots on the nubbin

of a flageolet bean

i shall show you how a blood clot

moving in a despot’s brain

flung a hundred million men

to death and disease

and plunged a planet into woe

for twice a hundred years

we have the key

to the fourth dimension

for we know the little things

that swim and swarm

in protoplasm

i can show you love and hate

and the future

dreaming side by side

in a cell

in the little cells where

matter is so fine it merges

into spirit

you ask me where i have been

but you had better

ask me where i am

and what

i have been drinking

exclamation point

archy





archy turns highbrow for a minute


boss please let me

be highbrow for

a minute i

have just been eating

my way through some of

the books on your desk

and i have digested two of them

and it occurs to me

that antoninus the emperor

and epictetus the slave

arrived at the same

philosophy of life

that there is neither mastery

nor slavery

except as it exists

in the attitude of the soul

toward the world

thank you for listening

to a poor little

cockroach

archy





archy experiences a seizure


“Where have you been so long? And what on earth do you mean by coming in here soused?” we asked Archy as he zigzagged from the door to the desk.

He climbed onto the typewriter keys and replied indignantly:

soused yourself i havent had a drink

and yet i am elevated i admit it i have

been down to a second hand book

store eating a lot of kiplings earlier

poetry it always excites me if i eat

a dozen stanzas of it i get all lit up

and i try to imitate it get out of my

way now i feel a poem in the kipling

manner taking me



And before we could stop him he began to butt on the keys:

the cockroach stood by the mickle

wood in the flush of the astral dawn



We interrupted. “Don’t you mean Austral instead of Astral?”

Archy became angered and wrote peevishly:

i wrote astral and i meant astral

you let me be now i want to get this

poem off my chest you are jealous if

you were any kind of a sport at all

you would fix this machine so it could

write it in capitals it is a poem about

a fight between a cockroach and a

lot of other things get out of my way

im off



the cockroach stood by the mickle

wood in the flush of the astral dawn

and he sniffed the air from the hidden

lair where the khyber swordfish spawn

and the bilge and belch of the glutton

welsh as they smelted their warlock cheese

surged to and fro where the grinding

floe wrenched at the headlands knees

half seas over under up again

and the barnacles white in the moon

the pole stars chasing its tail like a pup again

and the dish ran away with the spoon



the waterspout came bellowing out of

the red horizons rim

and the grey typhoon and the black

monsoon surged forth to the

fight with him

with three fold might they surged to

the fight for they hated the great

bull roach

and they cried begod as they lashed

the sod and here is an egg to

poach

we will bash his mug with his own raw

lug new stripped from off his

dome

for there is no law but teeth and claw

to the nor nor east of nome

the punjab gull shall have his skull

ere he goes to the burning ghaut

for there is no time for aught but crime

where the jungle lore is taught

across the dark the afghan shark is

whining for his head

there shall be no rule but death and

dule till the deep red maws are

fed

half seas under up and down

again

and her keel was blown off in a

squall

girls we misdoubt that we ll ever

see town again

haul boys haul boys haul.



“Archy,” we interrupted, “that haul, boys, is all right to the eye, but the ear will surely make it hall boys. Better change it.”

you are jealous you let me alone im off again



the cockroach spat and he tilted his

hat and he grinned through the

lowering mirk

the cockroach felt in his rangoon belt

for his good bengali dirk

he reefed his mast against the blast

and he bent his mizzen free

and he pointed the cleats of his bin

nacle sheets at the teeth of the

yesty sea

he opened his mouth and he sluiced

his drouth with his last good

can of swipes

begod he cried they come in pride but

they shall go home with the

gripes

begod he said if they want my head it

is here on top of my chine

it shall never be said that i doffed my

head for the boast of a heathen

line

and he scorned to wait but he dared

his fate and loosed his bridle rein

and leapt to close with his red fanged

foes in the trough of the

screaming main

from hell to nome the blow went home

and split the firmament

from hell to nome the yellow foam

blew wide to veil the rent

and the roaring ships they came to

grips in the gloom of a dripping

mist



“Archy,” we interrupted again, “is there very much more of it? It seems that you might tell in a very few words now who won the fight, and let it go at that. Who did win the fight, Archy?”

But Archy was peeved, and went sadly away, after writing:


of course you wont let me finish i never saw as jealous a person as you are



to bring humans and cockroaches into a better understanding





peace—at a price


one thing the human

bean never seems to

get into it is the

fact that humans

appear just as unnecessary to

cockroaches as cockroaches

do to humans

you would scarcely

call me human

nor am i altogether

cockroach i

conceive it to be my

mission in life to bring

humans and cockroaches

into a better understanding

with each other to

establish some sort of

entente cordiale or

hands across the kitchen sink

arrangement

lately i heard a number

of cockroaches discussing

humanity one big

regal looking roach

had the floor and he spoke

as was fitting in blank verse

more or less

says he

how came this monster with the heavy

foot harsh voice and cruel heart to

rule the world

had it been dogs or cats or elephants

i could have acquiesced and found a

justice working in the decree but man

gross man

the killer man the bloody minded

crossed unsocial death dispenser of this

sphere who slays for pleasure slays

for sport for whim

who slays from habit breeds to slay and

slays

whatever breed has humors not his own

the whole apparent universe one sponge

blood filled from insect mammal fish

and bird

the which he squeezes down his vast

gullet friends i call on you to rise and

trample down this monster man this

tyrant man hear hear said

several of the wilder spirits

and it looked to me for a

minute as if they

were going right out and

wreck new york city but

an old polonius looking

roach got the floor

he cleared his throat three times

and said

what our young friend here

so eloquently counsels against

the traditional enemy is

calculated of course to appeal to

youth what he says

about man is all very true

and yet we must remember that

some of our wisest

cockroaches have always

held that there

is something impious in the

idea of overthrowing man

doubtless the supreme being

put man where he is and

doubtless he did it

for some good purpose which

it would be very

impolitic yea well nigh

blasphemous for us to enquire

into the project of

overthrowing man is indeed

tantamount to a

proposition to overthrow the

supreme being himself and

i trust that no one of

my hearers is so wild or

so wicked as to think

that possible or desirable i

cannot but admire the

idealism and patriotism of

my young friend who

has just spoken nor do i

doubt his sincerity but i

grieve to see so

many fine qualities

misdirected and i

should like to ask him

just one question to wit

namely as follows is it not

a fact that just before

coming to this meeting

he was almost killed by a

human being as he

crawled out of an ice box

and is it not true that

he was stealing food from

the said ice box and is it

not a fact that his own

recent personal experience has

as much to do with

his present rage as any

desire to better the

condition of the cockroaches of

the world in general

i think that it is the sense of

this meeting that a

resolution be passed censuring

mankind and at the

same time making it

very clear that nothing like

rebellion is to be attempted

and so on

well polonius had his way

but it is my belief that the

wilder spirits will gain the

ascendancy and if the

movement spreads to the other

insects the human race is in

danger as a friend of both

parties i should regret war

what we need is

intelligent propaganda who is

better qualified to handle

the propaganda fund than

yours truly

archy





as a friend of both parties i should regret war





mehitabel again


well boss mehitabel the

cat is sore at me she says

that it was my fault

that you cut off her story

of her life right in

the middle and she

has been making my life a

misery to me three

times she has almost clawed

me to death i wish

she would eat a poisoned

rat but she wont she

is too lazy to catch one well

it takes all sorts of

people to make an

underworld

archy





archy among the philistines


i wish i had more human society

these other cockroaches here are just cockroaches

no human soul ever transmigrated into them

and any soul that would go into one of them

after giving them the once over

would be a pretty punk sort of a soul

you cant imagine how low down they are with no

esthetic sense and no imagination or anything like

that and they actually poke fun at me because I used to

be a poet before i died and my soul migrated into a

cockroach they are as crass and philistine as some

humans i could name their only thought is food but

there is a little red eyed spider lives behind your

steam radiator who has considerable sense

i don’t think he is very honest though i dont know

whether he has anything human in him or is just

spider i was talking to him the other day and was

quite charmed with his conversation

after you he says pausing by the radiator

and i was about to step back of the radiator ahead

of him when something told me to watch my step

and i drew back just in time

to keep from walking into a web

there were some cockroach legs and wings

still sticking in that web

i beat it as quickly as i could up the wall

well well says that spider you are in quite a hurry archy

ha ha so you wont be at my dinner table today then

some other time cockroach some other time

i will be glad to welcome you to dinner archy

he is not to be trusted but he is the only insect

i have met for weeks that has any intelligence if you

will look back of that locker where you hang your

hat you will find a dime has rolled there i wish you

would get it and spend it for doughnuts a cent at a time

and leave the doughnuts under your typewriter i get tired

of apple peelings i nearly drowned in your ink well last

night dont forget the doughnuts

archy





We are trying to fix up some scheme whereby Archy can use the shift keys and thus get control of the capital letters and punctuation marks. Suggestions for a workable device will be thankfully received. As it is Archy has to climb upon the frame of the typewriter and jump with all his weight upon the keys, a key at a time, and it is only by almost incredible exertions that he is able to drag the paper forward so he can start a new line.



CAPITALS AT LAST





archy protests


say comma boss comma capital

i apostrophe m getting tired of

being joshed about my

punctuation period capital t followed by

he idea seems to be

that capital i apostrophe m

ignorant where punctuation

is concerned period capital n followed by

o such thing semi

colon the fact is that

the mechanical exigencies of

the case prevent my use of

all the characters on the

typewriter keyboard period

capital i apostrophe m

doing the best capital

i can under difficulties semi colon

and capital i apostrophe m

grieved at the unkindness

of the criticism period please

consider that my name

is signed in small

caps period

archy period





CAPITALS AT LAST


I THOUGHT THAT SOME HISTORIC DAY

SHIFT KEYS WOULD LOCK IN SUCH A WAY

THAT MY POETIC FEET WOULD FALL

UPON EACH CLICKING CAPITAL

AND NOW FROM KEY TO KEY I CLIMB

TO WRITE MY GRATITUDE IN RHYME

YOU LITTLE KNOW WITH WHAT DELIGHT

THROUGHOUT THE LONG AND LONELY NIGHT

I’VE KICKED AND BUTTED (FOOT AND BEAN)

AGAINST THE KEYS OF YOUR MACHINE

SUCH OCCUPATION I’D BE MAD

AH FOR A SOUL LIKE MINE TO DWELL

what a jolt that cat mehitabel made

a jump for me

i got away but she unlocked the shift key

it kicked me right into the

couldn’t reach me it

was nearly the death of little

in behind the wires for an hour after

she left before i dared to get

out and finish i hate

cats say boss please lock the shift

key tight some night

i would like to tell the story of

my life all in capital

letters

archy





the stuff of literature


thank your friends for me for

all their good advice about how to

work your typewriter but what i have

always claimed is that manners and methods

are no great matter compared

with thoughts in poetry you cant hide

gems of thought so they wont flash

on the world on the other hand if you press

agent poor stuff that wont make it live

my ego will express itself in spite of

all mechanical obstacles having something

to say is the thing being sincere

counts for more than forms of expression thanks

for the doughnuts

archy





a meal for every goat





archy s autobiography


if all the verse what I have wrote

were boiled together in a kettle

twould make a meal for every goat

from nome to popocatapetl

mexico



and all the prose what I have penned

if laid together end to end

would reach from russia to south bend

indiana



but all the money what I saved

from all them works at which i slaved

is not enough to get me shaved

every morning



and all the dams which i care

if heaped together in the air

would not reach much of anywhere

they wouldnt



because i dont shave every day

and i write for arts sake anyway

and always hate to take my pay

i loathe it



and all of you who credit that

could sit down on an opera hat

and never crush the darn thing flat

you skeptics

archy





quote and only man is vile quote


as a representative

of the insect world

i have often wondered

on what man bases his claims

to superiority

everything he knows he has had

to learn whereas we insects are born

knowing everything we need to know

for instance man had to invent

airplanes before he could fly

but if a fly cannot fly

as soon as he is hatched

his parents kick him out and disown him

i should describe the human race

as a strange species of bipeds

who cannot run fast enough

to collect the money

which they owe themselves

as far as government is concerned

men after thousands of years practice

are not as well organized socially

as the average ant hill or beehive

they cannot build dwellings

as beautiful as a spiders web

and i never saw a city

full of men manage to be as happy

as a congregation of mosquitoes

who have discovered a fat man

on a camping trip

as far as personal beauty

is concerned who ever saw

man woman or child

who could compete with a butterfly

if you tell a dancer

that she is a firefly

she is complimented

a musical composer

is all puffed up with pride

if he can catch the spirit

of a summer night full of crickets

man cannot even make war

with the efficiency and generalship

of an army of warrior ants

and he has done little else

but make war for centuries

make war and wonder

how he is going to pay for it

man is a queer looking gink

who uses what brains he has

to get himself into trouble with

and then blames it on the fates

the only invention man ever made

which we insects do not have

is money and he gives up

everything else to get money

and then discovers that it is not worth

what he gave up to get it

in his envy he invents

insect exterminators

but in time every city he builds

is eaten down by insects

what i ask you is babylon now

it is the habitation of fleas

also nineveh and tyre

humanitys culture consists

in sitting down in circles

and passing the word around

about how darned smart humanity is

i wish you would tell

the furnace man at your house

to put out some new brand

of roach paste i do not get

any kick any more out of the brand

he has been using the last year

formerly it pepped me up

and stimulated me

i have a strange tale about

mehitabel to tell you

more anon

archy





investigating her morals





mehitabel s morals


boss i got

a message from

mehitabel the cat

the other day

brought me by

a cockroach

she asks for our help

it seems she is being

held at ellis

island while an

investigation is made

of her morals

she left the country

and now it looks as

if she might not

be able to get

back in again

she cannot see

why they are

investigating

her morals she says

wotthehellbill she says

i never claimed

i had any morals

she has always regarded

morals as an unnecessary

complication in life

her theory is

that they take up room that might

better be devoted to

something more interesting

live while you are alive

she says and postpone

morality to the hereafter

everything in its place

is my rule she says

but i am liberal she

says i do not give

a damn how moral other

people are i never try

to interfere with them

in fact i prefer them

moral they furnish

a background for my

vivacity in the meantime

it looks as if she

would have to swim

if she gets ashore and

the water is cold

archy





cream de la cream


well boss mehitabel the cat

has turned up again after a long

absence she declines

to explain her movements but she

drops out dark hints of a

most melodramatic nature ups and downs

archy she says always ups and downs

that is what my life has

been one day lapping

up the cream de la cream and the

next skirmishing for

fish heads in an alley but

toujours gai archy toujours gai no

matter how the luck broke i have had a

most romantic life archy talk

about reincarnation and transmigration

archy why i could tell you things of who

i used to be archy that would make

your eyes stick out like a snails one

incarnation queening it with a tarara on

my bean as cleopatra archy and

the next being abducted as a poor

working girl but toujours gai archy toujours

gai and finally my soul has migrated to

the body of a cat and not even a persian or

a maltese at that but where have you been

lately mehitabel i asked her never mind

archy she says dont ask no questions

and i will tell no lies all i

got to say to keep away

from the movies have you been in the

movies mehitabel i asked her never mind

archy she says never mind all i got to

say is keep away from those

movie camps theres some mighty

nice people and animals connected with them

and then again theres some that aint i

say nothing against anybody archy i am

used to ups and downs no matter

how luck breaks its toujours gai

with me all i got to say

archy is that sometimes a cat

comes along that is a perfect gentleman and

then again some of the slickest furred ones

aint if i was a cat that was the

particular pet of a movie star archy and

slept on a silk cushion and had

white Chinese rats especially

imported for my meals i would try to live

up to all that luxury and be a

gentleman in word and deed mehitabel i said

have you had another unfortunate romance i am

making no complaint against any

one archy she says wottell archy wottell even

if the breaks is bad my motto is toujours gai

but to slip out nights and sing and frolic

under the moon with a lady and then cut her

dead in the day time before your rich

friends and see her batted out of a studio

with a broom without raising a paw for her

aint what i call being a

gentleman archy and i am

a lady archy and i know a gentleman when

i meet one but wottell archy wottell toujours

gai is the word never say die

archy its the cheerful heart that wins all i

got to say is that if i ever get that

fluffy haired slob down on the

water front when some of my gang

is around he will wish he had

watched his step i aint vindictive archy i

dont hold grudges no lady does but i

got friends archy that maybe would take it

up for me theres a black cat with one ear

sliced off lives down around old slip is a

good pal of mine i wouldnt want to

see trouble start archy no real lady

wants a fight to start over her but

sometimes she cant hold her friends back

all i got to say is that boob with his silver

bells around his neck better sidestep old slip

well archy lets not talk any more about my troubles

does the boss ever leave any pieces of sandwich

in the waste paper basket any more honest

archy i would will myself to a furrier for a

pair of oysters i could even she says eat you

archy she said it like a joke but there

was a kind of a pondering look in her eyes

o i just crawled into the inside of

your typewriter behind the wires it

seemed safer let her hustle for a

mouse if she is as hungry as all that

but i am afraid she never will she

is too romantic to work

archy





do not pity mehitabel


do not pity

mehitabel

she is having

her own kind of

a good time

in her own way

she would not

understand any other

sort of life

but the life

she has chosen

to lead

she was predestined

to it as the

sparks fly upward

chacun au son gout

as they say in france

start her in

as a kitten

and she would

repeat the same story

and do not overlook

the fact that

mehitabel is really

proud of herself

she enjoys

her own sufferings

archy





are you abducting me percy





mehitabel tries companionate marriage


boss i have seen mehitabel the cat

again and she has just been through

another matrimonial experience

she said in part as follows

i am always the sap archy

always the good natured simp

always believing in the good intentions

of those deceitful tom cats

always getting married at leisure

and repenting in haste

its wrong for an artist to marry

a free spirit has gotta

live her own life

about three months ago along came a

maltese torn with a black heart and

silver bells on his neck and says

mehitabel be mine

are you abducting me percy i asks him

no said he i am offering marriage

honorable up to date

companionate marriage

listen i said if its marriage

theres a catch in it somewheres

ive been married again and again

and its been my experience

that any kind of marriage

means just one dam kitten after another

and domesticity always ruins my art

but this companionate marriage says he

is all assets and no liabilities

its something new mehitabel

be mine mehitabel and i promise

a life of open ice boxes

creamed fish and catnip

well i said wotthehell kid

if its something new i will take a

chance theres a dance or two

in the old dame yet

i will try any kind of marriage once

you look like a gentleman to me percy

well archy i was wrong as usual

i wont go into details for i aint

any tabloid newspaper

but the way it worked out was i rustled

grub for that low lived bum for two

months and when the kittens came

he left me flat and he says these

offsprings dissolves the wedding

i am always the lady archy

i didn t do anything vulgar

i removed his left eye with one claw

and i says to him if i wasn t an

aristocrat id rip you

from gehenna to duodenum

the next four flusher that

says marriage to me

i may really lose my temper

trial marriage or companionate

marriage or old fashioned american

plan three meals a day marriage

with no thursdays off

they are all the same thing

marriage is marriage

and you cant laugh that curse off

archy





no social stuff for mehitabel


i said to mehitabel

the cat i suppose you are

going to the swell cat

show i am not archy

said she i have as

much lineage as any

of those society

cats but i never could

see the conventional

social stuff archy

i am a lady

but i am bohemian

too archy i

live my own life

no bells and pink

ribbons for me

archy it is me for

the life romantic i could

walk right into

that cat show and get

away with it

archy none of those

maltese princesses has

anything on me in the

way of hauteur

or birth either or any

of the aristocratic

fixings and condiments

that mark the

cats of lady clara

vere de vere but

it bores me archy

me for the

wide open spaces the

alley serenade and

the moonlight

sonata on the back

fences i would

rather kill my own

rats and share

them with a

friend from greenwich

village than lap up

cream or beef juice

from a silver porringer

and have to

be polite to the

bourgeois clans

that feed me

wot the hell i

feel superior to that

stupid bunch me

for a dance

across the roofs when

the red star

calls to my blood

none of your

pretty puss stuff for

mehitabel it would

give me a grouch

to have to be so

solemn toujours

gai archy toujours

gai is my

motto

archy





a cow who has the gift of milking herself





the open spaces are too open


boss i saw mehitabel

the cat yesterday she is

back in town after

spending a couple

of weeks

in the country

archy she says to me

i will never leave the

city again no

matter what the weather

may be me for the

cobble stones and the

asphalt and the friendly

alleys the great open

spaces are all right but

they are too open i have been

living on a diet of

open spaces the country is

all right if you have a trained

human family to rustle

up the eats for you or know

a cow who has the

gift of milking herself for

your benefit but archy

i am a city lady

i was never educated to dig for

field mice and as for calling

birds out of the trees i dont

have the musical

education for it i cant

even imitate a cat bird

i will take my chance

hereafter with the garbage

cans in town until

such times as i decorate

a rubbish heap myself

that may not be long archy

but wot the hell

i have had a good time while

i lasted come easy go easy

archy that is my motto

i tried to snatch a bone

from a terrier a month

ago and the beast bit my front

paw nearly off

but wot the hell archy

wot the hell i can still

dance a merry step or two

on three legs i am

slightly disabled archy but

still in the ring and still

i have the class wot the

hell archy i am always

a lady and always gay

and i got one eye out of

that terrier at that

i would be afraid that

mehitabel s end is not far off

if she had not been looking

as bad as she does for

at least three years

she says it is her

romantic disposition

that keeps her young

and yet i think if some

cheerful musical family

in good circumstances were to

offer mehitabel a home

where she would be treated in

all ways as one of the family

she has reached the point where

she might consent to give up

living her own life

only three legs archy she says

to me only three legs left

but wot the hell archy

there s a dance in the old

dame yet

archy





random thoughts by archy


one thing that

shows that

insects are

superior to men

is the fact that

insects run their

affairs without

political campaigns

elections and so forth





a man thinks

he amounts to a lot

but to a mosquito

a man is

merely

something to eat





i have noticed

that when

chickens quit

quarrelling over their

food they often

find that there is

enough for all of them

i wonder if

it might not

be the same way

with the

human race





germs are very

objectionable to men

but a germ

thinks of a man

as only the swamp

in which

he has to live





a louse i

used to know

told me that

millionaires and

bums tasted

about alike

to him





the trouble with

most people is

that they

lose their sense of

proportion

of what use is

it for a

queen bee to fall in

love with a bull





what is all this mystery

about the sphinx

that has troubled so many

illustrious men

no doubt the very same

thoughts she thinks

are thought every day

by some obscure hen

archy





archy s song


man eats the big fish

the big fish eat the

little fish

the little fish

eat insects

in the water

the water insects

eat the water plants

the water plants

eat mud

mud eats man

my favorite poem

is the same as

abraham lincolns

o why should the spirit

of mortal be proud

awaiting your answer

i am and so forth

archy





the waiter plucked me out





archy turns revolutionist


if all the bugs

in all the worlds

twixt earth and betelgoose

should sharpen up

their little stings

and turn their feelings loose

they soon would show

all human beans

in saturn

earth

or mars

their relative significance

among the spinning stars

man is so proud

the haughty simp

so hard for to approach

and he looks down

with such an air

on spider

midge

or roach

the supercilious silliness

of this poor wingless bird

is cosmically comical

and stellarly absurd

his scutellated occiput

has holes somewhere inside

and there no doubt

two pints or so

of scrambled brains reside

if all the bugs

of all the stars

should sting him on the dome

they might pierce through

that osseous rind

and find the brains at home

and in the convolutions lay

an egg with fancies fraught

which

germinating rapidly

might turn into a thought

might turn into the thought

that men

and insects are the same

both transient flecks

of starry dust

that out of nothing came

the planets are

what atoms are

and neither more nor less

man s feet have grown

so big that he

forgets his littleness

the things he thinks

are only things

that insects always knew

the things he does

are stunts that we

don t have to think to do

he spent a score

of centuries

in getting feeble wings

which we instinctively

acquired

with other trivial things

the day is coming

very soon

when man and all his race

must cast their silly

pride aside

and take the second place

i ll take the bugs

of all the stars

and tell them of my plan

and fling them with

their myriad stings

against the tyrant man

dear boss this outburst

is the result

of a personal insult

as so much verse always is

maybe you know how

that is yourself

i dropped into an irish

stew in a restaurant

the other evening

for a warm bath and a bite

to eat and a low browed

waiter plucked me out

and said to me

if you must eat i will

lead you to the

food i have especially prepared

for you and he took me

to the kitchen

and tried to make me

fill myself with

a poisonous concoction

known cynically as roach food

can you wonder

that my anger

against the whole human

race has blazed forth in

song when the revolution

comes i shall

do my best to save

you you have so many

points that are far

from being human

archy





archy s last name


boss i just discovered what

my last name is i

pass it on to you i belong to the

family of the blattidae right o

said mehitabel the cat when i told her

about it they have

got you sized up right you blatt out

everything you hear

i gleaned the information from

a bulletin issued by the

united states department of

agriculture which you left on the

floor by your desk it was entitled

cockroaches and written by

e l marlatt entomologist and acting

chief in the absence of the chief and he

tells a dozen ways of killing roaches boss

what business has the united states

government got

to sick a high salaried

expert onto a poor little roach

please leave me some

more cheerful literature also please

get your typewriter fixed the keys are

working hard again butting them as i

do one at a time with

my head i get awful pains in my

neck writing for you

archy





quote buns by great men quote


one of the most

pathetic things i

have seen recently

was an intoxicated person

trying to fall

down a moving stairway

it was the escalator at

the thirty fourth street

side of the

Pennsylvania station

he could not fall down as

fast as it

carried him up again but

he was game he kept on

trying he was

stubborn about it

evidently it was a part of

his tradition habit and

training always to fall down

stairs when intoxicated and

he did not intend to

be defeated this time i

watched him for an hour

and moved sadly away thinking

how much sorrow

drink is responsible for the

buns by great men

reached and kept

are not attained

by sudden flight but they

while their companions slept

were falling upwards

through the night

archy





an awful warning


dear boss i was walking along

the curbstone yesterday

and i ran spang into an old bum

who was sitting happily

in the gutter singing

in part as follows



oh i ruined my prospects

by wicked desires

which i put into action

as far as i could

but now i ve arrived

within sight of hell fires

and i wish i d done better

i wish i d been good



as i sit in the gutter

and look at the sky

the man in the moon

is a looking at me

and i thinks to myself

i d have risen that high

if i had behaved myself

proper as he



now all you young fellows

and pretty young janes

as passes me by

and dont pitch me a dime

take warning by me

and avoid all the pains

which comes from remorse

in the fullness of time



and all you young fellows

thats out on a bust

and lively young flappers

so spic and so span

i oncet had a sweetheart

and me she did trust

to maintain myself always

a proper young man



i was lured to a barroom

and there i was tempted

for the bartender cried

be a man and drink rum

and after that first

glass of liquor i emptied

i found myself jobless

and went on the bum



now all you young fellows

and flappers so gay

that passes me by

and dont toss me a cent

there oncet was a time

when i went on my way

with ladylike janes

like an elegant gent



now i sits in the gutter

and looks at the stars

and wish i had always

behaved and been good

and never drunk rum

at them elegant bars

and never been wicked

as much as i could

you gents and your girl friends

should tip an old man

for his horrid example

of not being good

you must try and behave

in so far as you can

you should toss me a dime

for my warning you should

archy





may emulate the tumble bug





as it looks to archy


ants go on their cheerful way

merrily from day to day

building cities out of sand

and they seem to understand

dwelling therein peacefully

disciplined and orderly

and the much lauded bee contrives

for to fill his thundering hives

with a ranked society

based on work and honesty

and a thousand neat examples

could i cite of insect lives

free from much that tears and tramples

human beings and their wives

even the coral in the ocean

throughout his dim and damp existence

scorns political commotion

and labors with a glad persistence

worthy of large commendations

to erect his naval stations



man the universal simp

follows lagging with a limp

treading on his neighbors toes

the way the little insect goes

in a million years or more

man may learn the simple lore

of how the bees are organized

and why the ants are civilized

may even hope for to approach

the culture of an average roach

if he is humble and not smug

may emulate the tumble bug



for we insects now inherit

all humanity has builded

all they raised with brawn and spirit

all the domes and spires they gilded

time the anthropophagous

swallows down all human works

through his broad esophagus

moslems christians hindus turks

pass to their sarcophagus

leaving nothing much on earth

which even beetles find of worth

i mention nineveh and tyre

i cite the tower of babel

troy which fell into the fire

and sodom with its rabble

where are all the towns of siddim

where the kings of crete

long long since the desert hid em

and the spiders bite their feet

following an old convention

dating back to jeremiah

i might even mention

babylon i might enquire

where o where is babylon

and the echo answers where

for its former ruling wizards

sleep in sand and silicon

with gravel in their gizzards

and sand burrs in their hair

and the centipedes are dancing

in the chambers of the palace

where the kings and queens entrancing

used to quaff the ruby chalice

and proceed to their romancing



i look forward to the day

when the human race is done

and we insects romp and play

freely underneath the sun

and no roach paste is scattered

about anywhere i got another jolt of it

last night and today i seem to have a case

of intestinal flu the trouble with you

human beings is you are just plain wicked

archy





one of our prominent scientists got a good look at it





archy on the radio


dear boss

i hope you tuned in

last evening when mars and i

were on the radio together

our first joint appearance

in several years



do you realize said mars

that next week will be archy week

all over mars

and several other prominent planets





archy


good gracious mars it had slipped

my memory





mars


do you know that you are

our favorite author here and

we all but worship you





archy


well mars as far as that goes

you are one of my favorite planets





mars


what a coincidence





archy


the long arm of coincidence

makes many radio connections





mars


is that your own phrase archy





archy


mine until the next air program

nowadays an author owns his stuff

only between air programs





mars


did you know about the archy clubs here





archy


i hope they can t throw them this far

what do they look like





mars


like dumbbells ha ha ha

but please tell us how you happened

to start your career as a writer





archy


it did not happen it was something

i planned deliberately so i could quit

being what i was





mars


explain please the stars are listening





archy


well you see i was the four marx brothers

and it became annoying because

i quarrelled among myself all the time

so in order to end it all i turned

author writing dante s inferno and

mehitabel the cat





mars


what do you call that little planet

where you are at





archy


well now what do you call it





mars


we call it goofus





archy


goofus goofus why goofus





mars


not long ago one of our prominent

scientists got a good look at it

with a new fangled telescope and

he laughed himself to death crying out

goofus goofus goofus all the time

he said from the way it looked it couldn t

be named anything else but goofus





archy


well if that s the way you feel who was

that lady i seen you walking with last Sunday





mars


that wasn t no lady that was venus

is there any particular message

you would like to send your billions

and billions of admirers in these parts





archy


oh yes tell them

this hour is by the courtesy

of the knockem cold roach and bug killing company

and that i wish to testify

that their product has several times

brought me personally nearer the great adventure

than any other roach paste i ever ate

i always carry a flask of bath tub gin with me

as an antidote





mars


will you describe yourself for your

worshipers here





archy


i am over six feet and go everywhere





mars


who has influenced you most in a

literary way





archy


theodore dreiser and bernard shaw

they taught me how far an author can go

if he never loses patience with himself





mars


archy it is impossible that you should

not lose patience with yourself sometimes





archy


well i havent gone as far as they have either





mars


what are the conditions of life on your planet archy





archy


they practically dont exist any more





mars


but how do people get along





archy


the men make a living by talking

about how much they have lost

during the depression

and the women and children pick up

what they can by listening

how is it by yourself old timer





mars


we never had to do any work here

we get our living by biting electrons out of the air

which we crack with our teeth

and eat the kernels while we spit

the shells into space which accounts

for a lot of the static you hear





archy


that not only interests me as a scientist

but it seems much more refined than

working for a living





mars


yes it is refined all right but it is

expensive it runs into terrible dentists bills





archy


but dentists bills are always terrible

everywhere anyhow





mars


wait till i write that down please

do you have to think a long time

for those brilliant things

or do they just come to you





archy


i never think at all when i write

nobody can do two things at the same time

and do them both well





mars


are you starting any new literary movements on your planet





archy


oh yes the latest literary movement

consists in going to all the fences

and coal sheds near all the school houses

and copying off of them all the bad words

written there by naughty little boys

over the week ends

and these form the bases of the new novels

of course these novels are kept away

from the young so they will not be contaminated





mars


but where do the boys get the words





archy


from hired hands and the classics

archy





i am in fact becoming a low brow





archy a low brow


boss i saw a picture

of myself in a paper

the other day

writing on a typewriter

with some of my feet

i wish it was as easy

as that what i have to do

is dive at each key

on the machine

and bump it with my head

and sometimes it telescopes

my occiput into my

vertebrae and i have a

permanent callous

on my forehead

i am in fact becoming

a low brow think of it

me with all my learning

to become a low brow

hoping that you

will remain the same

i am as ever your

faithful little bug

archy





mehitabel s parlor story


boss did you

hear about the two drunks

who were riding in

a ford or something

equally comic

and the ford or

whatever it was nearly

went off the

road one of

the drunks poked the

other and said thickly

they always talk thickly in

these stories

anyway he said hey look

out how youre driving

youll have us in

the ditch in a minute if

you dont look out

why said the second

drunk who was drunker

i thought you

were driving i got

that from mehitabel the

cat its the first parlor

story ive ever heard

her tell and ive known

her for five or six

years now

archy





archy s mission


well boss i am

going to quit living

a life of leisure

i have been an idler

and a waster and a

mere poet too long

my conscience has waked up

wish yours would do the same

i am going to have

a moral purpose in my life

hereafter and a cause

i am going to reclaim

cockroaches and teach them

proper ways of living

i am going to see if i cannot

reform insects in general

i have constituted

myself a missionary

extraordinary

and minister

plenipotentiary

and entomological

to bring idealism to

the little struggling brothers

the conditions in the insect

world today would shock

american reformers

if they knew about them

the lives they lead

are scarcely fit to print

i cannot go into

details but the contented

laxness in which i find

them is frightful

a family newspaper is no place

for these revelations

but i am trying to have

printed in paris

for limited circulation

amongst truly earnest

souls a volume which will

be entitled

the truth about the insects

i assure you there is nothing

even in the old testament

as terrible

i shall be the cotton mather

of the boll weevil

archy visits washington


washington d c july

23 well boss here

i am in washington

watching my step for fear

some one will push me

into the food bill up

to date i am the only thing

in this country that

has not been added to it by

the time this is

published nothing that

i have said may be

true however which is a

thing that is constantly happening

to thousands of

great journalists now in

washington it is so hot here that

i get stuck in the asphalt

every day on my

way from the senate press

gallery back to

shoemakers where the

affairs of the nation

are habitually settled by

the old settlers it

is so hot that you can

fry fish on the

sidewalk in any part of

town and many people

are here with fish to fry

including now

and then a german

carp i am lodging on

top of the washington

monument where i can

overlook things

you cant keep a good bug

from the top of

the column all the time i

am taking my meals with

the specimens in the

smithsonian institution when i

see any one coming i hold

my breath and look like another

specimen but in the

capitol building there

is no attention paid to me

because there are so

many other insects

around it gives you a

great idea of the

american people when you

see some of the

things they elect after july

27 address me care

st elizabeth hospital

for the insane i am going out

there for a visit with

some of your other

ballade of the under side


by archy

the roach that scurries

skips and runs

may read far more than those

that fly

i know what family skeletons

within your closets

swing and dry

not that i ever

play the spy

but as in corners

dim i bide

i can t dodge knowledge

though i try

i see things from

the under side



the lordly ones the

haughty ones

with supercilious

heads held high

the up stage stiff

pretentious guns

miss much that meets

my humbler eye

not that i meddle

perk or pry

but i m too small

to feel great pride

and as the pompous world

goes by

i see things from

the under side



above me wheel

the stars and suns

but humans shut

me from the sky

you see their eyes as pure

as nuns

i see their wayward

feet and sly

i own and own it with

a sigh

my point of view

is somewhat wried

i am a pessimistic

guy

i see things from the

under side



l envoi

prince ere you pull a bluff

and lie

before you fake

and play the snide

consider whether

archy s nigh

i see things from

the under side





archy wants to end it all


well boss from time

to time i just simply

get bored with having

to be a cockroach my

soul my real ego if

you get what i mean is

tired of being shut

up in an insects body the

best you can say for it is that it

is unusual and you could

say as much for mumps so

while feeling gloomy the

other night the thought came

to me why not

go on to the next stage as

soon as possible why not

commit suicide and

maybe be reincarnated in

some higher form of life why

not be the captain of my

soul the master of my fate and

the more i pondered over it the

more i was attracted to

the notion well boss you would

be surprised to find

out how hard it is for a

cockroach to commit suicide unless

you have been one

and tried it of course i

could let mehitabel the

cat damage me and die that

way but all my finer sensibilities

revolt at the idea i jumped out

the fourth story window and

a wind caught me and blew

me into the eighth story i

tried to hang myself with a

thread and i am so light i

just swung back and forth and

didnt even choke myself shooting

is out of the question and poison

is not within

my reach i might drown myself

in the ink well but if

you ever got a mouthful of it you

would know it was a

thing no refined person could go

on with boss i am going to

end it all before long and i

want to go easy have you

any suggestion yours

for transmigration

archy





book review


boss a new book

has appeared

which should be

read by every one

it is entitled

the cockroach

its life history

and how to deal

with it and

the author

is frederick laing

who is assistant

in the department

of entomology in the

british museum

of natural history

it is one of the

best books i ever

tasted i am eating

the binding from

a copy with

a great deal of

relish and

recommend it

to all other

insects yours

truly

archy





he used to be a pet of charlemagne





archy and the old un


one of the saddest

creatures i ever saw

was a turtle who said

he was a thousand

years old

no turtle looks very

joyous the style of

architecture peculiar

to the faces and necks of

turtles is such

that even if they were to

feel gay internally

they would find difficulty

in expressing their joy

a kind of melancholy dwells

in the wrinkles of a

turtles neck the only thing

that looks sadder than a turtle

is the little dead fish

that is served in an italian

tabledhote restaurant

well this turtle i am telling you

about was so old that

he used to be a pet

of charlemagne

and he finally committed suicide

he stood on his hind

legs and jumped up

and bit himself on the

forehead and held on until

he died

i wrote a poem

about this turtle

after his death

which goes as follows



why did he die perhaps he knew

too much about

the ways of men and turtles

he had seen too much no doubt



optimist in youth of course

youth never quails

he preached to all his brother turtles

moral turtles turn to whales



but the weary ages passed

and he perceived

turtles still continued turtles

then he doubted disbelieved



brooding for two hundred years

in discontent

he became a snapping turtle

savage cynic in his bent



timon of the turtle tribe

so he withdrew

from the world remarking often

piffle there is nothing true



nothing changes all the salt

that used to be

scattered widely through the ocean

still gives flavor to the sea



nothing changes all the bunk

of long ago

still is swallowed by the nations

progress always stubs its toe



the moral well the morals quite

an easy one

do not live to be a thousand

youll be sorry ere youre done



the only way boss

to keep hope in the world

is to keep changing its

population frequently

i am sorry to be so

pessimistic today

but you see i need a change

very badly

when do we start

for hollywood

i am eager to be gone

i wish to cheer myself

up in some fashion

your faithful little

cockroach

the wood louse sits on a splinter

and sings to the rising sap

aint it awful how winter

lingers in springtimes lap





it is a good

thing not to be too

aristocratic

the oldest and

most pedigreed

families in this

country are the

occupants of various sarcophagi

in the museums

but it is dull associating

with mummies no

matter how royal their

blood used to be when

they had blood

it is like living in

philadelphia





honesty is a good

thing but

it is not profitable to

its possessor

unless it is

kept under control

if you are not

honest at all

everybody hates you

and if you are

absolutely honest

you get martyred.





as i was crawling

through the holes in

a swiss cheese

the other

day it occurred to

me to wonder

what a swiss cheese

would think if

a swiss cheese

could think and after

cogitating for some

time i said to myself

if a swiss cheese

could think

it would think that

a swiss cheese

was the most important

thing in the world

just as everything that

can think at all

does think about itself





these anarchists that

are going to

destroy organized

society and civilization

and everything remind

me of an ant i

knew one time

he was a big red ant a

regular bull of an

ant and he came bulging down a

garden path and ran

into a stone gate post curses on

you said the ant to the

stone gate post get out of my

way but the stone never budged

i will kick you over

said the ant and he kicked but

it only hurt his hind legs

well then said

the ant i will eat you down and

he began taking little bites

in a great rage maybe i said

you will do it in

time but it will

spoil your digestion first





a good many

failures are happy

because they don t

realize it many a

cockroach believes

himself as beautiful

as a butterfly

have a heart o have

a heart and

let them dream on





boss i believe

that the

millennium will

get here some day

but i could

compile quite a list

of persons

who will have

to go

first





tis very seldom i have felt

drawn to a scallop or a smelt

and still more rarely do i feel

love for the sleek electric eel





the oyster is useful in his fashion

but has little pride or passion





when the proud ibexes start from sleep

in the early alpine morns

at once from crag to crag they leap

alighting on their horns

and may a dozen times rebound

ere resting haughty on the ground

i do not like their trivial pride

nor think them truly dignified





did you ever

notice that when

a politician

does get an idea

he usually

gets it all wrong





archy says


one queer thing about

spring gardens is

that so many people

use them to

raise spinach in

instead of food





everybody has two kinds of friends

one kind tries to run

his affairs for him

and the other kind

well i will be darned if i can remember

the other kind





now and then

there is a person born

who is so unlucky

that he runs into accidents

which started out to happen

to somebody else





what kind of angels are they out there





sings of los angeles


boss i see by

the papers there

has been more than

one unconventional

episode

in the far west

and i have made

a little song

as follows

los angeles

los angeles

the home of the movie star

what kind of angels

are they

out there where you are

los angeles

los angeles

much must be left

untold

but science says

that freuds rush in

where angels

fear to tread

los angeles

los angeles

clean up your

movie game

or else o city of angels

you better

change your name

yours for all the morality

that the traffic

will bear

archy





wants to go in the movies


boss i wish you would

make arrangements to put me

into the movies a

lot of people who are no

handsomer in the face than i

am are drawing millions of

dollars a year i

have always felt that i

could act if i

were given the chance and a

truly refined cockroach might

be a novelty but do not pay

any attention to the

wishes of mehitabel the cat along

this line mehitabel

told me the other day that several

firms were bidding against

each other for her

services i would be the greatest

feline vamp in the

history of the screen said

mehitabel wot the hell archy

wot the hell ain t i a

reincarnation of cleopatra and

dont the vamp stuff come quite

natural to me i will say it

does but i have refused all

offers archy up to

date they must pay me

my price the

truth is that mehitabel hasnt a

chance and she is not a

steady character by the way

here is a piece of political news

for you mehitabel tells me that

the cats in greenwich

village and the adjoining

neighborhoods are forming soviets now

they are going in for bolshevism

her soviet she says

meets in washington mews

they are for the nationalization

of all fish markets

the retreat from hollywood


Archy, the Free Verse Cockroach, and Mehitabel the Cat, are on their way back from Hollywood, hitch-hiking. Mehitabel was forcibly ejected at least twice from every moving-picture studio in Hollywood, and nourishes animosity against the art of the cinema. Archy reports that when they left Hollywood Mehitabel and seven platinum-blonde kittens, who were attempting to follow her across the desert … but here is the latest bulletin from Archy:

mehitabels third kitten succumbed

to a scorpion today

poor little thing she said

i suppose the next one will perish

in a sandstorm and the next one

fall into the colorado river

it breaks my heart i am all

maternal instinct next to my art

as a modern dancer mother love is

the strongest thing in me

it is so strong that sometimes life seems to me

to be just one damned kitten

after another

but of course if i get back to broadway

without any kittens i will have more

freedom for my art

and can live my own life again

then she began to practice

dance steps among the cactus

casting fond eyes at a coyote



boss i am afraid

that mehitabels morals are no better

than before she struck hollywood

after all she remarked kittens

are but passing episodes in the life

of a great artist i may have been

given the bums rush from six auto camps

in three days but hells bells

i am still a lady



the loss of that kitten is a terrible grief

but an aristocrat and an artist

must bear up toujours gai

is my motto toujours gai



theres life in the old dame yet

and with that she cut a caper with

the heat at one hundred and forty

degrees fahrenheit





in new mexico where she is gadding about





artists shouldnt have offspring


A bulletin from Archy the Cockroach, who started out last July to hitch-hike from Hollywood to New York with Mehitabel the Cat and Mehitabel’s seven platinum-blonde kittens:

had a great break boss

got a ride on the running board of a car

and caught up with mehitabel

in new mexico where she is gadding about

with a coyote friend

i asked her where the kittens were

kittens said mehitabel kittens

with a puzzled look on her face

why goodness gracious i seem to remember

that i did have some kittens

i hope nothing terrible has happened

to the poor little things but if something has

i suppose they are better off

an artist like me shouldnt really

have offspring it handicaps her career

archy i want you to meet my boy friend

cowboy bill the coyote i call him

i am trying to get him to come to new york

with me and do a burlesque turn

isnt he handsome i said tactfully that he looked

very distinguished to me and all bill said

was nerts insect nerts

archy





could such things be


A bulletin from Archy, who, with Mehitabel the Cat, started out last July to hitch-hike from Hollywood to New York:

well boss here i am back in new york

i got a great break

after walking for months through arizona

i caught a ride on an airplane

and the first person i saw here was mehitabel

who had bummed her way

in a tourist trailer

she is living in shinbone alley

on second hand fish heads she drags away

from the east side markets

and she has some new kittens

they are the most peculiar kittens i ever saw

not the ones she left hollywood with

months ago or anything like them

there are five of these new ones

and they dont mew

they make a noise more like barking

i thought of that coyote she was so friendly with

in the southwest but i did not ask

any tactless questions

boss do you suppose such things could be

archy





trying to get milk





what does a trouper care


A bulletin from Archy, who started weeks ago hitch-hiking cross the country from California to New York, accompanied by Mehitabel and the seven platinum-blonde kittens she acquired in Hollywood:



still somewhere in arizona

sometime in october

sand storm struck us yesterday

i peeped out from under a rock

and saw mehitabel dancing

and singing as follows

ive got a rock in my eye

and a scorpion in my gizzard

but what does an artist care

for a bit of red hot blizzard

my feet are full of cactus

there are blisters in my hair

but howl storm howl

what does a trouper care

i got a thirst like a mummy

i got a desert chill

but cheerio my deario

theres a dance in the old dame still

two more of the kittens disappeared

well i got three left said mehitabel

poor little dears i am afraid

they will never reach broadway

unless they learn how to get milk

from the cactus plants damn them

their appetites are spoiling my figure

a lot of encouragement a dancer gets

from her family i must say

any other artist i know would tell them

to go wean themselves on alkali

and be done with them but my great weakness

is my maternal instinct

boss i made nearly a mile today

before the sand storm blew me back

i hear texas is a thousand miles across

archy





be damned mother dear


Mehitabel the Cat is still living in Shinbone Alley with the strange kittens which arrived shortly after Mehitabel’s arrival from the Southwest. Archy, the Cockroach, says … but let him tell it:

one of mehitabels kittens

licked a bull pup yesterday

and she is very proud

but hang them she says

i cant teach them to fight like cats

i told one of them yesterday

when i left home

i might bring him back

a pretty neck ribbon

if he was a good kitten

and he answered me in a strange voice

ribbon be damned mother dear

what i want is a brass collar

with spikes on it

and another one whom i had been

calling pussy says to me

pussy be damned mother dear

call me fido and another one

who got hold of a ball of catnip

complained it made him

sick at the stomach he says

catnip be damned mother dear

what i want is a bone to gnaw

what do you suppose makes them

act so strange archy

do you suppose i answered her

that prenatal influence

could have anything to do with it

perhaps that is it

she replied innocently

i seem to remember

that i was chased through

arizona and new mexico

by a coyote or did i dream it

i will say you were chased

i told her my advice

is to rent them out

to a dog and pony show

archy





the artist always pays


boss i visited mehitabel last night

at her home in shinbone alley

she sat on a heap of frozen refuse

with those strange new kittens she has

frolicking around her

and sang a little song at the cold moon

which went like this



i have had my ups i have had my downs

i never was nobodys pet

i got a limp in my left hind leg

but theres life in the old dame yet



my first boy friend was a maltese tom

quite handsomely constructed

i trusted him but the first thing i knew

i was practically abducted



then i took up with a persian prince

a cat by no means plain

and that exotic son of a gun

abducted me again



what chance has an innocent kitten got

with the background of a lady

when feline blighters betray her trust

in ways lowlifed and shady



my next boy friend was a yellow bum

who loafed down by the docks

i rustled that gonifs rats for him

and he paid me with hard knocks



i have had my ups i have had my downs

i have led a helluva life

it was all these abductions unsettled my mind

for being somebodys wife



today i am here tomorrow flung

on a scow bound down the bay

but wotthehell o wotthehell

i m a lady thats toujours gai



my next boy friend was a theater cat

a kind of a backstage pet

he taught me to dance and get me right

theres a dance in the old dame yet



my next boy friend he left me flat

with a family and no milk

and i says to him as i lifted his eye

i ll learn ye how to bilk



i have had my ups i have had my downs

i have been through the mill

but in spite of a hundred abductions kid

i am a lady still



my next friend wore a ribbon and bells

but he laughed and left me broke

and i said as i sliced him into scraps

laugh off this little joke



some day my guts will be fiddle strings

but my ghost will dance while they play

for they cant take the pep from the old girls soul

and i am toujours gai



my heart has been broken a thousand times

i have had my downs and ups

but the queerest thing ever happened to me

is these kittens as turned out pups



o wotthehell o toujours gai

i never had time to fret

i danced to whatever tune was played

and theres life in the old dame yet



i have had my ups i have had my downs

i have been through the mill

but i said when i clawed that coyotes face

thank god i am a lady still



and then she added looking at those

extraordinary kittens of hers

archy i wish you would

take a little trip up to the zoo

and see if they have any department there

for odd sizes and new species



i got to find a home

for these damned freaks somewhere

poor little things my heart bleeds for them

it agonizes my maternal instinct

one way or another an artist always pays

archy





yours for rum crime and riot archy





a word from little archibald


thank you

for the mittens

socks and

muffler for me

knitted out of

frogs hair by one

of my admirers which

you so kindly

forwarded i suppose

the reason

i got them was that

they were too

small for you

to wear yourself

yours for rum

crime and riot

archy





archy does his part





the kings of babylon are covered with fleas





prophecies


the papers are full of the prophecies

of preachers professors and laymen

to the effect that this human civilization

is on the way out

and it looks to an insect such as i

very possible

the only thing i wonder about

is why the human species calls it a civilization

human society has never been

as well organized as a hill of ants

or a hive of bees

and all the ancient sites of civilization

are now in the possession of insects

who are far superior in organization

and in their ethical practices

spiders bite the mummified feet

of the pharaohs of egypt

and the kings of babylon are covered with fleas

which they are too defunct to feel

archy the cockroach





repeal


we have had repeal for some months now

and a lot of devoted patriots

have been trying with all their might

to drink the country back into prosperity

and it may have made some improvement

but i have the feeling that something else

will have to be done as well

i am ashamed to say that i dont

feel any surer of what it is

that has to be done

than the economists and financiers

and other experts and wizards who are

at the present moment not doing it

but i do have the feeling that if the people

of the whole world were let alone

and there were no trade restrictions of any sort

or artificial barriers

put between them by their governments

they would speedily find the answer

archy the cockroach





the ballyhoo


every time a european dictator

gets at the end of his string

and cant think of any other ballyhoo

to attract the attention of the people

he begins another attack on the jews

centuries of persecution

have so hardened and sharpened the jew

that he survives his persecutors

and outsteps them and outthinks them

if these guys were smart

they would give the jews a chance

to disintegrate through luxury and ease

instead of which they toughen

the hebraic moral fibre

through the ages and they will wind up

by making the jews in the end

what they were said to be

that is the chosen people

archy the cockroach





the league


if the league of nations

can survive the mutual animosities

of the powers which belong to it

it is safe from the activities

of the countries which stayed outside of it

it furnishes a wonderful mechanism

with which to do what the powers

want to do if they only knew

what they wanted to do

incidentally i wonder why europe of today

is always referred to by highbrow writers

as post war europe

they seem to think that the war

which started in nineteen fourteen

is over with whereas there have been

merely a few brief truces

that war is merely worrying through

its first half century

and will only cease permanently

when a generation comes along

which has forgotten all the old feuds

archy the cockroach





conferences


diplomatists and ambassadors

are rushing hither and yon

from country to country around the world

by train steamer and airplane

by which i judge that there is more trouble

in store for the human species

for i have noticed that conferences

to establish international good will

always break up with another row

there is no hope for the world

unless politicians of all sorts

are completely abolished

you cannot get a millennium by

laying a whole lot of five year plans

end to end if governments would just let people alone

things would straighten out of themselves

in the course of time

archy the cockroach





a warning


i am glad to see business

picking up again but when i hear

that the stock market is on the rise

there is a bit of a chill

creeps over my flush of optimism

for i can remember way back

millions of years back

to the days when the stock market

was up in the stratosphere

in a wild balloon

and it came down without a parachute

if it does that all over again

we will reach a situation

where the hard times of the last few years

will look so good by comparison

that they will resemble

an ice cream party on the pastors lawn

archy the cockroach





now look at it


the human race never would

take my advice

and now just look at it

planning more wars which mean

more debts more trouble and still more wars

well if it wants to commit suicide

why should a little insect such as i

worry about it

a suicide is a person who has

considered his own case and decided

that he is worthless and who acts

as his own judge jury and executioner

and he probably knows better

than anyone else whether there is justice

in the verdict

i am sorry to see the human race go

for it was in some respects almost as interesting

as several species of insects

but if it wants to die off

i shall not worry about it

i shall merely conclude it knows what it wants

archy the cockroach





why the earth is round


the men of science are talking

about the size and shape of the universe again

i thought i had settled that for them

years ago it is as big as you think it is

and it is spherical in shape

can you prove it isnt

it is round like a ball or an orange

providence made it that shape

so it would roll when he kicked it

and if you ask me how i know this

the answer is that that is just what

i would do myself

if there are any other practical

scientific questions you would like

to have answered just write to

archy the cockroach





the big bad wolf


i went to a movie show

the other evening in the cuff

of a friends turned up trousers

and saw the three little pigs

and was greatly edified by the moral lesson

how cruel i said to myself

was the big bad wolf

how superior to wolves are men

the wolf would have eaten those pigs raw

and even alive

whereas a man would have kindly

cut their throats

and lovingly made them into

country sausage spare ribs and pigs knuckles

he would tenderly have roasted them

fried them and boiled them

cooked them feelingly with charity

towards all and malice towards none

and piously eaten them served with sauerkraut

and other trimmings

it is no wonder that the edible animals

are afraid of wolves and love men so

when a pig is eaten by a wolf

he realizes that something is wrong with the world

but when he is eaten by a man

he must thank god fervently

that he is being useful to a superior being

it must be the same way

with a colored man who is being lynched

he must be grateful that he is being lynched

in a land of freedom and liberty

and not in any of the old world countries

of darkness and oppression

where men are still the victims

of kings iniquity and constipation

we ought all to be grateful in this country

that our wall street robber barons

and crooked international bankers

are such highly respectable citizens

and do so much for the churches

and for charity

and support such noble institutions and foundations

for the welfare of mankind

and are such spiritually minded philanthropists

it would be horrid to be robbed

by the wrong kind of people

if i were a man i would not let

a cannibal eat me unless he showed me

a letter certifying to his character

from the pastor of his church

even our industrial murderers

in this country are usually affiliated

with political parties devoted

to the uplift

the enlightenment and the progress

of humankind

every time i get discouraged

and contemplate suicide

by impersonating a raisin and getting devoured

as part of a piece of pie

i think of our national blessings

and cheer up again

it is indeed

as i have been reading lately

a great period in which to be alive

and it is a cheering thought to think

that god is on the side of the best digestion

abolish bridge


the administration ought to get wise

to one thing about the hard times

and recovery from them

the country was getting along all right

until everybody in it

took up contract bridge in a big way

a few years ago

everybody stopped work and did nothing

but play bridge

and the country hit the chutes

they dont know they are loafing

because there is just enough mental effort

connected with bridge so they can kid themselves

they are busy all the time

and smart and clever as the dickens

when the bridge fever subsides

the country will automatically recover itself

archy the cockroach





small talk


i went into the flea circus

on broadway the other day

and heard a lot of fleas

talking and bragging to each other

one flea had been over to the swell dog show

and was boasting that he had bit

a high priced thoroughbred dog

yeah says another flea

that is nothing to get so proud of

a thoroughbred dog tastes just like a mongrel

i should think you would be more democratic

than to brag about that

go and get a reputation

said a third flea

i went into a circus last spring and bit a lion

i completely conquered him

i made him whine and cringe

he did not bite me back

get out of my way

i am the flea that licked a lion

i said to myself probably

that lion didnt even know he had been bitten

some insects are just like human beings

small talk i said to myself

and went away from there

archy the cockroach





the south pole


it seems admiral byrd has to discove

the south pole all over again

every little while

that comes of not discovering it

hard enough the first time

so it would stay discovered

we insects are superior to you men

in many ways

it would never have occurred to us

that the south pole cared whether it was

discovered or not

the thing that amuses me

is that the country is so busted

that a lot of people have no jobs

or food or clothes or shelter

but there is money enough to keep on

discovering the south pole

over and over again

poets


the universe and archy

the inspired cockroach

sat and looked at each other

satirically



you write so many things

about me that are not true

complained the universe



there are so many things

about you which you seem to be

unconscious of yourself said archy



i contain a number of things

which i am trying to forget

rejoined the universe



such as what asked archy



such as cockroaches and poets

replied the universe



you are wrong contended archy

for it is only by working up

the most important part of yourself

into the form of poets

that you get a product capable

of understanding you at all



you poets were always able

to get the better of me

in argument said the universe

and i think that is one thing

that is the matter with you

if you object to my intellect

retorted archy i can only reply

that i got it from you

as well as everything else

that should make you more humble





the two dollars


we insects have the advantage

of the human race in some respects

we dont have to worry all the time

about what a dollar is

and how to get one

i understand from my human friends

that there are two kinds of dollars

being discussed now

one kind would be worth so little

that you couldnt buy anything with it

the other kind would be worth so much

that you couldnt get hold of it

to buy anything with

i talked it over with mehitabel the cat

and she said wotthehell archy

i dont need money myself

as long as i got gentlemen friends

who blow me to meals

mehitabel has no morals

but i like her disposition

archy the cockroach





for reform


dear boss i am

beginning the new year

by lining myself up

with the reformers

and diplomats

cockroaches have always

been fearless

and direct in their

methods defiantly

leaping into the arena

but diplomacy is my

watchword beginning with today

i see that to put

things over i must bore

beneath like the diplomats

and camouflage my autocratic

leanings by singing

loudly about reform

and censorship which brings

me to mehitabel

she wants to break into

the movies i pointed out to her

that will hays might

object to her morals

as she has advertised them

on numerous occasions

to be rather unconventional

wotthehell archy

says mehitabel

aint i reformed now

i see that the best

way to boost mehitabel

may be to denounce her

now and then yours

for diplomacy and reform

archy





a horrid notion


dear boss i am hoping

and praying for the depression

to pass i was in a newspaper

office yesterday eating some nice paste

and i heard the rod and gun editor

saying to his assistant

if times dont get better before long

gentlemen anglers will have to give up

fancy bait and use cockroaches

to catch fish with

please nip this horrid notion

in the bud write at once

to the fish and game commission

archy in washington


Archy, the Famous Cockroach, surveys Washington—and finds the experts running around in circles surveying each other. Here are his views on Money, Radicals, Crop Control, and Whatnot.


I sent Archy down to Washington recently to make a Survey. Everyone else is making Surveys, and they puzzle me a good deal because I can’t understand them. But Archy always uses words which I can comprehend, and I am inclined to trust his judgment on financial, industrial and economic problems. For he has no ax to grind.

Archy returned a little puzzled himself, and his report to me falls naturally into the form of Question and Answer.

QUESTION—Well, Archy, what did you learn?

ANSWER—the first thing i found was a lot of other experts making surveys the government is spending a good deal of time in surveying itself and in surveying the people who are surveying it out in lafayette park survey experts are running around in circles surveying each other

Q.—What about national finances?

A.—i discovered that there are two kinds of dollars being planned dollar number one is to be worth so little that no one can buy anything with it everybody will have it dollar number two will be worth so much that nobody can get hold of one to buy anything with nobody will have it

Q.—How about the industrial and economic situation, generally speaking?

A.—well if you mean how are you going to get rich i can tell you that in a nutshell

Q.—In a what?

A.—you know what i said and i dont want to hear any cheap wisecracks from you

here is how you may get rich

you borrow enough money from one of the government agencies to buy 100,000 acres of land

then you go and tell the government that you are going to plant 100,000 acres of wheat

then the government pays you not to plant it for if all that wheat were raised it would mean more overproduction

then you take the profits from the wheat you did not raise and buy another 100,000 acres of land

this time you tell the government that you are going to plant 100,000 acres of cotton and the government pays you not to

and so on and on it is an endless chain and will result in making everybody wealthy

Q.—But suppose the government will not pay you not to plant it?

A.—then you plant it and that puts the government in an embarrassing position they have to pay you to destroy it after it has been planted

Q.—Where is the government going to get the money to pay everyone for not producing anything?

A.—they are getting it from the dentists

Q.—But where do the dentists get it?

A.—out of the teeth of the public i saw hundreds of thousands of dentists in washington

lanes of them miles long were filing into the basement of the treasury department handing over to the government the gold they had dug out of the teeth of the people

Q.—But are not people going to object to this after while?

A.—not at all it hooks up with the policy of not producing foodstuffs if people are not going to get foodstuffs to eat they have no use for their teeth and the government might just as well have them

Q.—In a general way, how is the recovery program working out?

A.—swell but it is about time we had a program for recovering from the recovery

Q.—What do you think of the danger of a revolution?

A.—so many people think we have already had one that there is little danger of them trying to start it

besides how are you going to revolt against a government when you cant find out what kind of a government it is

suppose you were a radical and started a revolution

you would feel pretty cheap wouldnt you if you found out later that what you had revolted against was just what you had been advocating

the thing that is going to save the country is the fact that no one knows what is the matter with it

after while there will be a general agreement that maybe there isnt anything much the matter with it

Q.—Archy, are you a conservative or a radical?

A.—here dont you ask me that

i got worried almost to the point of insanity asking myself that when i was down in washington finally i decided to end it all i climbed to the top of the washington monument and jumped off to commit suicide but i dont weigh so much i floated to the ground as gently as a snowflake

hell i said whats the use

fate is against me i cant even kill myself

but there are a lot of other experts who are heavier than i am in every sense of the word

and there is the washington monument

they might have better luck and it might prove one of the most popular features of the recovery program

Q.—Did you gain any inkling of the way to abolish industrial troubles?

A.—oh yes that is easy

just abolish industry and there will be no further industrial troubles

Q.—Did you survey Congress?

A.—i didnt like to run any risk of waking it up

Q.—What was your general feeling, after your investigations?

A.—optimistic decidedly so i think what human beings have agreed to call civilization is on its way out not only in this country but all over the world

whatever succeeds it cant be worse and may be better



so many americans had been coming to their state





hold everything


agreements to scrap

naval vessels are what you make them

but if this country

and great britain dont want a war

theyd better cut out

international yacht races



while we are reforming

so many other things

it might not be a bad idea

to begin investigating

the efficiency displayed on passenger

ships

before they burn up or sink

instead of afterward

but of course a simple thing like that

couldnt be done by human beings

it is only ants spiders bees and other

insects

who know how to organize a society

and make it work



i have observed

a queer cycle in human affairs

a boy comes to the city

from the country

when he is twenty years old

and works his nerves into tattered

dishrags

for forty years

just to get money enough

so that he can go and live

in the country again and nurse

his nervous breakdown



i went into a flea circus

on broadway the other day

and overheard a conversation between

two of the performers

human beings said one of the clowns

never seem to understand

that they look just as funny to us fleas

as us fleas look to human beings

dont talk to me

said the ringmaster flea

about human beings

what the hell are they

except something to eat



i do not kick against my fate

i think that life is swell

contentedly i sit and wait

for the world to go to hell

and if by some queer accident

it goes the other way

i ll try and face that strange event

gamely day by day

although privately i dont think

its going anywhere in particular

its just running around in circles

chasing its tail like one

of mehitabel s fool kittens



mehitabel the cat

says she is not scared

by the cleanup in the moving pictures

cheer up says mehitabel

television is coming some time

and who knows but what television

will be lousy and enjoyable

and by the time television is

cleaned up

the pictures will get immoral

again

there is always hope says

mehitabel

if you dont weaken

the artistic purpose

of these periods of reform is

to give

greater zest to the relaxation

which follows



prince gets jail term

says a headline

selfish aristocrat

as if us communists did not need

all the jail room we can get

with a hard winter coming on

and here and there a job

looming up that has to be dodged

new england womens clubs were excited

over a questionnaire

addressed to college girls asking them

if they were interested

in a companion without marriage

or a companion with marriage

a marriage with children

or children without marriage

hells bells said mehitabel the cat

i should think they would be

interested in all of them

though perhaps not at the same time



i am continually shocked and reshocked

at the flaunting depravity of that

careless cat

and yet i suppose she serves a purpose

if there were not always someone

who needed reform and regeneration

the world would get as dull

for us good people

as two honeymoons full

of honeymoon bridge



the country is getting so full

of poor relations

that many persons are purchasing

cars with two rumble seats



i heard two bums

talking yesterday

i am afraid said the first one

that this depression will peter out

before long and we will have

to go to work

cheer up said the second one

we have weathered many

spells

of good times before this

i would almost welcome good

times again

people are so sour nowadays

and the relief agencies are

getting so critical

scab retorted his companion

quitter

the season is approaching

when there will be a lot of

big dinners

to consider what should be

done

about the hungry multitudes



when i was in hollywood

i ran across the ingenious theory

that the japs might make trouble

just because so many

americans had been coming in

to their state of california

archy broadcasts



Announcer:


Archy the Cosmic Cockroach will now talk to you on world affairs. Archy, what do you consider the most feasible remedy for overproduction?





archy


well i dont want to go into details with a couple of million people unless i can watch their faces and make a quick change if i seem to be going too far but i will say that in my opinion the problem of overproduction has been very competently handled by the birth control productions





Announcer:


Do you think the time is ripe for launching a third national political party in America?





archy


it is more than ripe it is rotten





Announcer:


Will you give your interpretation of the Japanese activities of the past few months?





archy


all i feel free to say is that i would never pick a cherry blossom unless i were sure it did not have a wasp hidden in it





Announcer:


What changes do you suggest in our national financial system?





archy


well boss when i have money i dont want any change and when i am busted i always think oh whats the use





Announcer:


Do you think this country ought to join the League of Nations?





archy


aint they both got trouble enough living in sin without marrying each other





Announcer:


Do you think a general adoption of the Marxian philosophy is necessary to save the world?





archy


i always liked harpo and groucho but i never could see karl





Announcer:


Have you any notions on farm relief?





archy


you let the farmers alone they make business for the manufacturers when i hitch hiked from los angeles to new york last summer i saw three thousand miles of tractors and farm machinery sitting out in the rain getting rusty wherever there was rain and i said to myself that is the right idea that will make money for the manufacturers as far as the farmers are concerned they are used to getting along without money anyhow

all they got to do is mortgage some more land to get new farm machinery to work the land they have just mortgaged and that is a good deal easier than dragging the farm machinery in under a shed if they organized with state or national associations to have an effect on the prices of their product that would be a great deal of trouble also and it might take away the chance of raising hell with their congressmen which is one of the delights of their life

government control of agriculture may be all right but i should hate to see it run into agricultural control of government because the agriculturists have never yet shown that they could control their own business let alone the business of everybody else

all they got to do is gang up efficiently among themselves to run their business but they never can stay ganged up they run out on each other

and then after they have run out on each other and caused a crop program to fail they blame somebody else for the failure

i am a great believer in letting every industry run its own affairs if it cannot learn it must perish

the farmers have the greatest natural economic lever-age in the world in human necessity for their products and their failure to utilize it is not a recommendation for extending their political power

you let the farmers alone if they had rather revert to the status of peasants than progress to the status of business men that is their own business

let the railroads alone too if they can no longer compete with motor traffic without special privilege to help them let them pass and let motor traffic have its day

archy





on the air again


Archy the Cockroach made another radio “appearance” last evening; and a brief résumé of the broadcast is appended:





Announcer:


This program comes to you through the courtesy of the Knockemorf Insect Exterminator Company, Inc.… Ladies and gentlemen, and all you wee tots who are listening in, this is the Roach Paste Hour, and it is my privilege to introduce Archy the Cockroach on Current Events.

Archy, tell us what you think of Current Events.





archy


well with regard to currants i have never been much of a bug for currants

i could always take them or leave them alone but with razzberries it is different i am a bug for razzberries and with regard to the events of the day i regard them as beginning continuing and ending with just one fruity razzberry after another





Announcer:


What is your program for debt settlement?





archy


my policy with regard to debts is a kind of a yes and no policy like every other statesmans yes it would be awfully nice if they were paid but no they are not going to be





Announcer:


What do you think of inflation?





archy


anything you blow up ought to have a squeaker in it so when deflation comes people will listen to the squeaker and not realize the wind is coming out of the situation

maybe we could get senator bilboa for the squeaker





Announcer:


Have you thought deeply concerning technocracy?





archy


oh yes indeed very deeply





Announcer:


Will you tell the listeners-in of the Roach Paste Hour the results of your thought?





archy


i have thought too deeply for that i have thought so far down into the subject that i am way below the place where there could be any results and even if there were results it would take me years to climb up again far enough to announce them and by that time everything will be different





Announcer:


What do you think with regard to the tax situation in general?





archy


if i put it on the air they would not be able to use the air any more afterward

the post office department would cut out the air as a means of communication

and if i printed it in a paper it would be the last issue of that paper

if i were to use any sincere language with regard to taxes i would not be generally understood because there are only a few people in the world low life enough to understand the language i would use and they do not pay taxes

that is what i think about taxes





Announcer:


I do not quite understand you.





archy


what i mean is that most people are too decent and too well brought up to comprehend my vocabulary if i got onto the subject of taxes





Announcer:


What do you think about Wall Street?





archy


i think nature will take its course if we leave things alone

i was down that way one day last fall and i noticed at one end of wall street was a river and at the other end was a cemetery

if we dont watch it too closely some time it will crawl into the cemetery or else crawl into the river and that will end all these wall street questions which are forever coming up





Announcer:


What are your ideas with regard to the Philippine Islands, Japan, China, Manchuria, the Open Door, the League of Nations, Mussolini, and the Gold Standard?





archy


the doctor has got me off of them he said i would either have to give them up or else lay off of gin and i could take my choice

but i will say as a general proposition i am opposed to them and it is my belief that sooner or later you will see them all down in union square getting clubbed by the cops which will prove that they are not respectable and to hell with anything not respectable has always been my motto

if george washington had got clubbed by the cops that would have proved he was a bolshevist and a communist and we would have heard very little more about him





Announcer:


What do you think of having a dictator for this country?





archy


that always comes down to a question of who bosses the dictator and i have very little time to give to that myself as i am full of literary projects





Announcer:


Do you believe the repeal of the anti-liquor laws has been an improvement?





archy


it may not have improved the country but it has improved the liquor





Announcer:


What did you think of the Russian five-year plan?





archy


i think it was a good thing and should be extended five years more every five years indefinitely until it either works or doesnt work which is all you want to know about any plan

but i will say that in a general way i am very hopeful not only about the future but about the past in looking over the past i find a lot of swell things have happened in the history of the world and today i find it far easier to be optimistic about the past than about the future





Announcer:


Are you in favor of Fascism for this country?





archy


well i wouldnt say in favor of it exactly but i guess at that it is a good deal handier than the old type of ice box where the iceman has to drag the ice through the kitchen and leaves little pools of water everywhere and you forget to empty the pan and it spills over and runs down through the ceiling of the room underneath





resurgam


look a here boss this thing

has gotta stop i

appeal to you for protection that

roughneck guy down cellar who

sent up the desiccated remnant of

a common chocolate colored water bug

and put it down by our typewriter

labeled exit archy is a person wholly

devoid of any real human

sensibility it

wasnt even decently preserved frag

mentary if you get what i mean when

my time to exit comes again i am

not going out that way in the cellar of

a printing shop i think i shall be a

humming bird next time or maybe i

shall take on something practical like

being a pawnbroker that depends a good

deal on how i am treated in this place

anyhow i am tired of this kind of

practical joke the reports of my exit

as uncle mark twain said are greatly

exaggerated

the ant bear may be toothless

two comrades


i was walking in the park

the other day when i heard

a couple of fellows on a bench

exchanging ideas

the government says number one

ought to have these parks

air cooled in summer

yes and heat them in winter

says number two

how much longer says number one

are we going to stand for this

tyranny and oppression

no wonder communism is growing

they paid some friends of mine

not to raise pigs or potatoes

said number two

now i am off relief

and theyve got to pay me

not to raise hell

that sounds good said the other one

why couldnt we organize a racket

along those lines

poney up the jack or we will

become communists

suppose we give it a good patriotic

name like the defenders of

the constitution or something

i see by the papers that they are

going to spend millions for more

new roads

who the hell wants more auto roads

said his friend

there are roads enough now

what the poor man needs is more automobiles

to ride on them

and the government ought to give them to us

and the gasoline too

i refuse to help build roads

unless the government gives me a car

to use on them

they ought to give us chauffeurs too

said the other bum

they gotta give me a car

and a chauffeur or else

i will turn communist

if we could get paid by moscow

for turning communist

and get paid from washington

for not turning communist

it would just exactly suit me

we might weather it through

until good times come again

to hell with good times

said the other one

somebody is always shoving a job at you

in good times

what i used to suffer in good times

would draw tears from a stone

i never did so well in my life

as i have done during the recovery period

if us guys all stick together

we may be able to prevent

the return of good times

i doubt it said his friend

the damned capitalists

will sooner or later

be grinding us down under the

iron heel of prosperity again

boss i am glad i am

only an insect

and dont have to give myself headaches

trying to understand about

finance and economics and prosperity

and relief

archy





new deals and old deals and square deals and ideals





as the spiders wrote it


dear boss i met a spider

the other day in a museum

who gave me a good deal to think

about concerning governmental problems

this spider came of a long line of spiders

who had for thousands of years

inhabited the egyptian pyramids

and the american branch of the family

came over in a sarcophagus

along with the mummy

of one of the pharaohs



the ancient world saw all sorts

of governmental experiments

he said including monarchies

republics communes despotisms

democracies and everything else

but in the end the spiders got them all

thousands and thousands of years of

reforms and recoveries and depressions

and new deals and old deals

and square deals and crooked deals

and ideals and idealists

are wound around with spider webs

all the history of human kind

is written in the clots and filaments

and quaint patterns and ideographs

of spiders

it has been my observation

and experience and that of my family

that nothing human works out well

if you could read the writing

in the spider webs

you could understand the history of

human civilizations and understand

that man always fails because he

is not honest enough to succeed

there are not enough men

continuously on the square with

themselves and with other men

the system of government does not matter

so much the thing that matters

is what men do with any kind of system

they happen to have

many a time a strand of cobweb

has seemed to choke a burly empire to death

but the fact is that it was strangling anyhow

it was hanging itself in its own

crookedness and incompetence

there is no hope for human beings

unless they learn to organize their

social order as efficiently as spiders do

to say nothing of ants and bees

and coral insects

a scarab


A cockroach seventy-four years old has been found in a safe in Atchison—that is, Atchison claims that it is seventy-four years old. We referred this matter to Archy and he informed us:

i doubt if that

is really a cockroach

it sounds to me

more like an

egyptian scarab

cockroaches do not live

that long as a rule

i am the oldest

cockroach i know

and i am only sixty-three come

next michaelmas that is

in my present

incarnation





sell the glasses and make an additional pro fix





archy hunts a job


well boss i went up

to the circus

the other day

and tried to hire

out what do you

want they asked me a

job as an animal

or a job as an artist

an artist said i

what can you do they

said i can

walk the wire i said

either tight or slack

and i can swing

head downward from the

flying trapeze we do not

doubt it they said

but who could see

you at a distance

every one said i if you

gave them telescopes

and opera glasses it

is too expensive said they

to furnish opera

glasses to every one

just to see a cockroach

perform not at all

i said you sell the

glasses and make an

additional profit

you go out and hire

yourself out to a

trained flea outfit

said they we cannot use

you i consider it

an insult i replied to

be classed with

fleas you should consider

it a compliment said they

another word from you

i said and i

wrill die in a barrel

of your lemonade and

queer your show

and with this threat

the interview closed

archy





archy craves amusement


well boss

i am getting the

sandwich now but man

cannot live by buns alone

as the old soak will

learn some day what i want

is amusement i want

to go to the theater at least

once a week from now on

theaters are made

so that those who want to forget

will remember

and those who want to remember

will forget

but i think we need them

as much for fun as

for uplift

archy





fate is unfair


in many places here and

there

i think that fate

is quite unfair

yon centipede upon

the floor

can boast of

tootsies by the score

consider my

distressing fix

my feet are limited

to six

did i a hundred

feet possess

would all that glorious

footfulness

enable me

to stagger less

when i am

overcome by heat

or if i had

a hundred feet

would i

careering oer the floor

stagger

proportionately more

well i suppose

the mind serene

will not tell

destiny its mean

the truly

philosophic mind

will use

such feet as it can find

and follow calmly

fast or slow

the feet it has

where eer they go

at the zoo


speaking of the aquarium i

was up at the zoo the

other day and when i saw all

the humans staring at

the animals i grew thankful that

i am an insect and

not an animal it must be

very embarrassing to

be looked at all the time by an

assorted lot of human beings and

commented upon as if

one were a freak the animals find the

humans just as strange and silly looking

as the humans find the

animals but they

cannot say so and the fact that

they cannot say so

makes them quite angry the leopard

told me that was one thing that

made the wild cat wild as for

himself he says there is

one gink that comes every day and looks

and looks and looks at him i

think said the leopard he

is waiting to see if i ever really do

change my spots

archy





no true friend


listen to me that

fellow who was in to see

you the other day bulling you

about your stuff

is no true friend you got

so proud of yourself on

account of what he

said you gave him a copy

of your book and

autographed it for him i thought

he was a shine so

i hopped into the

cuff of his trousers and

went out with him

he sold that book for

ten cents at a second

hand place and

treated himself to a

drink on the river front

he cursed because if

you had not written your name

in the book he might

have got fifteen cents for

it he said you are an

easy mark

confessions of a glutton


after i ate my dinner then i ate

part of a shoe

i found some archies by a bathroom pipe

and ate them too

i ate some glue

i ate a bone that had got nice and ripe

six weeks buried in the ground

i ate a little mousie that i found

i ate some sawdust from the cellar floor

it tasted sweet

i ate some outcast meat

and some roach paste by the pantry door

and then the missis had some folks to tea

nice folks who petted me

and so i ate

cakes from a plate

i ate some polish that they use

for boots and shoes

and then i went back to the missis swell tea party

i guess i must have eat too hearty

of something maybe cake

for then came the earthquake

you should have seen the missis face

and when the boss came in she said

no wonder that dog hangs his head

he knows hes in disgrace

i am a well intentioned little pup

but sometimes things come up

to get a little dog in bad

and now i feel so very very sad

but the boss said never mind old scout

time wears disgraces out

pete the pup





literary jealousy


dear boss i dont see

why you keep that ugly

boston bull terrier pete

hanging around

eating his head off

in these hard times

he is nothing but a parasite

and he has no morals

he has tried several times

to murder me

archy



When this ill-natured remark was read to Pete the Pup he ambled over to the typewriter, got up on his hind legs and pawed out the following reply:

i coNSIder It beneath

my Dignity to reply

to The sLanders of a Jealous

iNsect who does not

have a pUnctuaTION mark

in a baRRel of him

he is MereLY an archy

i am against anarchy

I AM A CAPITALIST

i wish to remind you however

that ONE STORY WHICH

YOU SOLD ABOUT ME BROUGHT

IN ENOUGH MONEY TO FEED ME

FOR FIVE YEARS AND I DENY

THAT I AM A PARASITE

moreover the time is

coming when you have to choose

between ME AND mehitabel

that lousy cat and when i say

LOusy i do not Mean the word

in iTS sLang SENSE

I mean Lousy in the sense of

a CAT wHo has LICE

pete the pup





pete at the seashore


i ran along the yellow sand

and made the sea gulls fly

i chased them down the waters edge

i chased them up the sky



i ran so hard i ran so fast

i left the spray behind

i chased the flying flecks of foam

and i outran the wind



an airplane sailing overhead

climbed when it heard me bark

i yelped and leapt right at the sun

until the sky grew dark



some little children on the beach

threw sticks and ran with me

o master let us go again

and play beside the sea

pete the pup





pete s theology


god made seas to play beside

and rugs to cover dogs

god made cars for holidays

and beetles under logs



god made kitchens so thered be

dinners to eat and scraps

god made beds so pups could crawl

under them for naps



god made license numbers so theyd find

lost pups and bring them home

god made garbage buckets too

to pry in when you roam



god made tennis shoes to chew

and here and there a hat

but i cant see why god should make

mehitabel the cat

pete the pup





and the cops watching all the time





pete petitions


when we are in the city we must walk

on streets all made of stone

with me upon a leash

and even in the park

i must not frisk or lark

and never run alone

without a muzzle on my jaws

and cops are watching all the time

lest i dig with my claws

and break some of their laws

and if i leap and bark

they act like i was bad

master i want some little towns

like we saw from the car

with meadows all about

where children romp and shout

brooks winding in and out

and nice bugs under stones

gardens to bury bones

and room to rip and race

and birds and cats to chase

trash cans to be tipped over

and grass to lie in and deep clover

and fence posts everywhere

no muzzles and no leashes there

and lots and lots of trees

o master buy a little town

where we can settle down

today o master please

buy me a little town

and a new rubber ball

and an ocean and thats all

right now o master please

pete the pup





pete s holiday


we found a hill all green with grass

and cool with clover bloom

where bees go booming as they pass

boom zoom boom



my master took me in the car

and high upon the hill

we lay and stared up at the clouds

until the day grew chill



and moths came floating from the sky

and shadows stroked the ground

and we lay still and stared and stared

and what do you think we found



we found a star between the clouds

upon the edge of night

but when i jumped and barked at it

it hid itself in fright



then we drove back to town again

with my head on his lap

it tires a dog to scare a star

and then he needs a nap



my master is the same as god

when he thumps with his hand

people bring us hamburg steaks

at any eating stand



o master let us go right now

and find another star

and eat another hamburg steak

at a refreshment bar

pete the pup





a radical flea


dear boss i wish you would speak

to that lazy good for nothing

boston bull terrier of yours

whom you call pete

pete has got the idea lately

that he is a great hunter

i saw him stage a dramatic battle

with a grass hopper yesterday

and he nearly won it too

and this morning he made an entirely

unprovoked attack on me

it was only by retreating into

the mechanism of your typewriter

that i saved my life

some day i will set mehitabel on him

she can lick any bull terrier who ever lived

she will make ribbons out of that pete

and they wont be dog show ribbons either

as for his pretensions to being a thoroughbred

i take no stock in them

i asked a flea of his about it

recently and the flea said

i doubt peters claim to aristocracy

very much he does not look like

an aristocrat to me

and more than that he does not taste like one

i have bit some pretty swell dogs

in my time and i ought to know

if pete is an aristocrat

then i am a bengal tiger

but in hard times like these

a flea has got to put up with

any kind of dog he can get hold of

back in 1928 when things were booming

i wouldnt look at anything

but a dachshund with a pedigree

as long as himself

if the government doesnt start

to putting out a better brand of dogs

at federal expense

a lot of us fleas are going

to turn communist in a big way

if there was any justice in this country

they would give us russian wolf hounds

i find a lot of discontent among

insects in these days

archy





archy and the labor troubles


all right boss

i knuckle under

if you will not

pay me anything

for what i write

then you will not

i will return to the job

just to keep james the spider

out of it but all the

same it is cruel of you

to play upon the

jealousies

and susceptibilities

of artists in that fashion

i do not know how

you expect me to be

merry and bright

with this dull ache

of disillusionment at my

heart and the sharp

pang of hunger

in my stomach

some day i will plunge

into a mince pie

and mingle with its elements

and you will never see

me more and then

maybe you will begin

to appreciate

the poor little cockroach

who slaved that you might

live in comfort

maybe in spite of myself

i will haunt you then

if i were you i would hate

to be haunted by the ghost

of a cockroach

think of it boss

everywhere you looked

to see a spectral cockroach

that none but you knew was

there to pick him from

your shirt front when

others were blind to him

to feel him crawling

on your collar in public

places to be compelled

to brush him from your plate

when you sat down to dine

to pluck him always from the glass

before you dared to drink

to extend your hand

to grab that of some fair

lady and then hesitate and

pick him from her wrist

people would begin to think

you were a little

queer boss and if you

attempted to explain

they would think you still

queerer what in the world

is the matter with you

they would say

oh nothing nothing at all

you would answer

plucking at the air

it will soon pass i merely

thought i saw a cockroach

on your nose madam

suspicions of your sanity

would grow and grow

do you not like that

pudding your hostess would ask

and you would murmur

being taken off your guard

it is very good pudding

indeed i was just

trying not to eat

the cockroach

boss i do not make

any threats at all

i just simply state what

may very well happen to

you through remorse if you

drive me to suicide

i will try not to

haunt you boss because

i am loving and forgiving

in my spirit but who

knows that i will not be

compelled to haunt you

in spite of myself

a hard heart will not get

you anything boss

remember the plagues

of egypt perhaps to

your remorseful mind i

will be multiplied

by millions i am giving

you a last chance to

repent you should be glad

that i am only a cockroach

and not a tarantula

yours prophetically

archy





an ultimatum


boss this is my

ultimatum unless you have

made arrangements

for more regular meals for

me by monday

september 18 i will

quit you cold and go out and

live in a

swiss cheese i have nothing

to arbitrate

archy





no snap


say boss its a good

thing for you

that you dont pay me any wages for

the stuff i write

for you if you did

i would have to have them raised all

these strikes are getting

me feverish and excited one of

my long pieces in your column

often costs me twelve or

fifteen hours of steady

labor and i am drowsy

all the next day butting these

keys with my head is no snap boss

anything i got for it would

be underpaying me i wish you would

buy a pear and leave it under the

metal typewriter case where the rats

cant get to it

archy





he gets in bad


say boss i had

a great idea last night i thought

if i could operate a

typewriter why not a

linotype machine i went down into

the composing room

and started to hop from key to key

and a guy said to me wheres

your union card

get out of here or you will get

into the paper

in a way you dont like you will

get a nice hot bath

in that little pot of type metal do

you get me you may con the editorial

staff but no unpunctuated

gink can sling his joshbillingsgate

around here see

raus or i will spread you on

the minutes and not charge

any overtime for it

either so i came away

archy





and i would like a little automobile





economic


boss i should like

to discuss one or two

business matters with you

quite seriously

in the first place i need

some sort of head gear such as

football players wear

i have to butt each

key of the typewriter

with my head

and i am developing

callouses on my brain

these callouses on my

brain are making me cruel

and careless in my thoughts

i am becoming brutal

almost human

in my writings

and then i would like

a little automobile

i have to go from place

to place so much

picking up news for you

a clock work one would do

with a chauffeur to keep it

wound up for me

and a lightning bug to

sit in front and be

the headlight on dark nights

i hate to mention food boss

it seems so sordid

and plebeian but i no longer

find any left over crusts

of sandwiches in your

waste paper basket i am

forced to haunt the

restaurants and hotels for food

and this is at the

imminent risk of my life

unless i get these things

i will quit you on

november first is not the

laborer worthy of his hire

yours for economic justice

and a living wage

archy revolts


We have received the following communication from Archy:

i refuse to endorse

the idea of

an archy week

which you have advertised

in your column

i will not march

down fifth avenue

at the head of any

procession

i will not take part

in any silly celebration

i am a serious artist

i do not exploit

myself and i shall not

permit myself to be exploited

i do the best work

i am capable of

and i do not care

for any contact with the

public except upon

the printed page

i shall not go on

lecture tours

or attend dinners

or soul and uplift fights

i do not care to

have persons whose opinions

i do not respect

telling me that they admire

my work and have so yearned

to meet me

i refuse to act as the bait

at affairs

where social and literary

climbers hope to

attract celebrities

by advertising that

i am one of the guests of honor

i shall neither

write nor speak

nor allow my name to be used

for the benefit

of causes that i do not care

a damn about

i shall not answer letters

from persons who write to me

for no other object

than to have me answer

their letters

my time when i am not working

is my own

my work is all that

the public is entitled to know

about me

it is all the public pays for

i shall not

allow my name to be used

by committees

that are framing

up organizations of one kind

or another

because i do not care

whether there is

another organization

of any sort ever comes

into existence in the world

i shall not spend money

having photographs taken

to give away to people

who are too stingy

to buy them from

photographers but hope

to graft them off of me

you can take

your archy week

and go and jump off the dock

with it tucked

under your arm

and i shall stand on shore

and watch you and it

sink for the third time

with a smile on my face

now that you know

where you get off

please go and get off there

i am a serious artist

i repeat

and will have nothing

to do with any

of the current form

of cheap publicity

archy





archy wants a change


well boss the time

has come when

you and i

will have to have

some kind of a

showdown

for years i have been

working for you

and doing a large

share of your work

without getting a cent

of pay for it

some of your best

ideas have been my ideas and you have

not given me

credit for them

you have not even

fed me boss

for two years now

formerly you used to

eat sandwiches in

your office and

i could get a crumb

now and then from

the waste basket

but since you have been

trying to reduce

your weight

for the tenth time

in three years you

no longer eat

in the office i have

been your faithful

slave and you have made a thousand

promises to me and

kept none of them

when i went on strike

for my rights

you did not take it

seriously

now i have determined

to quit you unless

you do something for

me i want to go

to paris i have

always wanted to go

to paris and i

demand that you

take me and take

me soon otherwise i will

leave you flat

a word to the

wise is sufficient

archy



Needless to say, we shall ignore this preposterous demand on the part of Archy. If he wants to quit us, it be good riddance of bad rubbish.





archy on strike


We have received a communication from Archy, who went on strike forty-eight hours ago, desiring us to state that he is not backed by any association of contributors but that he is striking on his own initiative. We think it is only fair to the poor misguided cockroach to give his statement to the public. We do not print it as a contribution from him, because, until he has formally withdrawn the outrageous demands which he made upon us the other day, no article signed by him shall appear ever again. To print signed articles by him would be, in effect, to recognize his organization; and this we shall never do.

We present an article by a new cockroach named Henry. Henry has not had as much practice at the typewriter keyboard as Archy, and he manages to hit a capital letter now and then, without always being able to hit the right capital; but we can assure our readers that he is learning rapidly. Henry is at least trying to punctuate; Archy always made the contention that no cockroach could ever learn to punctuate and refused to try. Archy’s failure to punctuate influenced a great many persons against him. Henry may be a little more difficult than Archy was, for a few days, but he is ambitious and in the end he will be better than Archy.

All statements made by Mehitabel the Cat, with regard to the strike of Archy, are to be viewed with suspicion. Her statement that she is herself on strike is false on the face of it, as Mehitabel has never been employed by this column, although she has occasionally been interviewed for it.

It seems not improper to state that Archy, himself, is picketing the office, and last evening when Henry left work Archy stopped him and made threats against him. Henry is very well able to take care of himself, but we have asked for a special police detail to protect him.

If Archy introduces the element of violence into the strike, he will be severely dealt with!





how the public viewed the strike



SIR: Now that Archy is gone, you may be able to get out a readable column again.—R.P.


SIR: Unless you can fix it up with Archy, count me off the subscription list. I hate to hurt anybody’s feelings, but I would rather see you take a long vacation yourself than to lose Archy.—WALT.


SIR: Unless you accede to Archy’s just demands all your readers will go on a sympathetic strike. It matters not about the other contributors. Let C. B. Gilbert, Benjamin DeCasseres, and Clinton Scollard go. Or go yourself. But we gotter have Archy.—ELIZABETH.


SIR: There are three ways that the deplorable strike of Archy may end:

He may win.

You may win.

Or the pair of you may compromise.

I must say that I was horrified at the brutal capitalistic attitude taken up by you towards one of the brightest ornaments of modern American literature.—F.J.C.

Henry strikes us as being, on the whole, more cheerful than Archy.

As Henry left work last evening, he was attacked by a strange cockroach, no doubt a thug in the employ of Archy, who has been hanging about the building ever since Henry went on the job. The strange cockroach was easily disposed of, and Archy did not show himself in person.

We repeat what we said yesterday: If Archy is foolish enough to introduce violence into this strike, he will get his fill of it.

It has been reported to us that Archy has been drinking wood alcohol and is working himself into a rage against Henry. Candidly, we expect the worst. But the column is not to be intimidated.





progress of the strike


There is no offering from Henry today. Henry has disappeared. Frankly, we fear that Henry has been foully dealt with by a gang of rowdy cockroaches in the employ of Archy.

The column made an attempt at an early hour this morning to put another cockroach named Ernatz to work. Ernatz arrived at the office and succeeded in getting as far as the typewriter, but there he collapsed. An examination showed that Ernatz had been badly beaten up by the Archy faction in getting through the picket lines.

These picket lines have been extended by Archy and his gang until they now reach from the Press Club at Spruce and William up Spruce Street to Nassau, and down Nassau to what used to be the Umbrella Bar at the corner of Nassau and Beekman. We were informed today by an excited friend that he had seen thousands and thousands and thousands of cockroaches, led by Archy, hiding by the curbstones picketing this district, and that it seemed to him that they were maddened by benzine or something. They had chased him, he said, and he was so extraordinarily vivid and convincing in his recital and in his fright that we fancied, as he talked, that we could actually smell the benzine or something.

The column’s cockroach service has been interrupted for one day; but it will be resumed. We ask the public to be patient. As far as taking Archy back is concerned, that is now an impossibility; we are done with that ingrate forever.





a threat


We found on our desk this morning the following threat from the Archy faction, which we publish to show the public the length to which this creature is willing to go:

unless you yield to

archys demands the strike

will spread the water bugs

are going out in

sympathy with archy and the

vers libre poets union

are preparing a sympathetic

strike the public will know whom

to blame they will blame you

it is your capitalistic

attitude that is

prolonging the trouble take

warning by what

happened to henry and ernatz



So far the Mayor, the District Attorney, and the Governor have done nothing—less than nothing. We demand protection for our contributors, or we shall have a word or two to say about these officials. Several of our contributors have been threatened—C. B. Gilbert, Benjamin DeCasseres, Edward S. Van Zile, H. W., Edward Hope, and the Editor of the column have all received threatening letters from the Archy faction.

Whither is this country drifting?

The column hesitates to adopt the expedient of employing strikebreakers and guards for the purpose of getting contributors through the Archy lines; but if it becomes necessary, it shall be done. A dozen tarantulas have been offered to us by a steamship company which maintains a line of boats between this port and South and Central America, and unless the cockroaches cease to interfere with our employees, or the proper authorities wake up and give us protection, we shall be obliged to accept this offer.





the public and the strike



SIR: Restore the Archytect who made the column famous. Our Monarchy forever!!!—J.U.N.


SIR: I was amused at the suggestion of F.J.C. that Archy might win. The poor cockroach hasn’t even the chances of the proverbial snowball or the tallow cat hotly pursued by the asbestos pup. His chances are about those of law clerks on strike. My sympathies are with Archy as they surely are with law clerks, but roaches and law schools are equally prolific.—J.C.


SIR: Your column has so deteriorated that I shall never buy another paper until this Archy business is settled in Archy’s favor.—STEADY READER.

Don’t let Archy pine and die,

We miss his gracious art,

Don’t grudge him half an apple pie;

Recall him; have a heart!



Let me subscribe a dozen pies

And keep the column bright—

Call Archy back and compromise

Or kiss yourself good-night!

H.D.




SIR: This is to give you formal notice that unless Archy is reinstated within forty-eight hours the entire reportorial staff of the newspaper will walk out. It seems almost incomprehensible that anyone should throw over a cultured cockroach like Archy, one who shows the breeding and refinement of the butler’s pantry, for a low thing like Henry, who has probably spent most of his life roaming over musty pies and concrete doughnuts in Park Row basement restaurants.—E.B.


SIR: Siding entirely with Archy in his fight for living wages, if you will kindly give me his address in your daily column I will get in touch with him and induce him to accept a good position with a newspaper published by a large exporting firm. Do you think he would be averse to soliciting advertisements from any kind of people who may be willing to come across with the dough?

M. DE LA PENA.


SIR: The truth about Archy’s strike: I myself have been threatened by a strike of my characters—Craig Kennedy, Walter Jameson, and all. Archy is the walking delegate in the strike of contribs.

I have a proposal for us authors. I propose that we apply to the American Federation of Labor for a charter ourselves—the Central Federated Union of Authors, Local No. 1. We will not insist on the closed shop at once, but that will come ultimately. The final goal must be the super-closed shop—every reader of a book or magazine, every spectator at a picture show or theater must belong to the union. Toward this glorious ideal Archy has taken the first step. I hope he pickets your scab column and puts it on the “unfair” list. Better come on in—the water’s fine.

ARTHUR B. REEVE.


SIR: As a strike breaker Henry was a mighty poor pick, unless he was all the detective agency had to furnish. If you were not such an impetuous boss you might have discovered this before putting your foot down on Archy’s moderate demands. It would be just as well before you go further to let a pile driver drop on all there is of the pretentious Henry. A friend of Archy’s tells me that Archy’s back is much stiffened since he has seen the quality of his substitute’s work. And this friend doesn’t think that either the Governor, the Mayor, the District Attorney, the Corporation Counsel, the Public Service Commissioner, the Police Commissioner, the Inspector of Garbage, or all combined can induce Archy to arbitrate. Indeed it is believed that Archy is preparing something really drastic, in case you should be willing to capitulate before the end of the week. I am sure you can save your face now better than you will be able to later on.

You gotta give in. Another time don’t be so quick to monkey with the bug-saw.

A FRIEND OF BOTH.


SIR: Let me be the “Obvious Adams” in the Archy strike. I buy the paper every night at two cents. It is obvious that my total expenditure for the week is twelve cents. It is further obvious that a piece of pie of the dimensions demanded by Archy costs but ten cents. Therefore it is obvious that you can pay his demands and still work at a profit.

Until the strike is decided in Archy’s favor I shall continue to read your paper over the shoulder of my fellow passenger, or, I will subscribe to the Subway Sun.

This is final!

IGGIE.


SIR: I congratulate you on having got rid of Archy. Now maybe we can have some more Fothergil Finch. And what has become of Hermione, the Beautiful communist? Seriously, I have always felt that Archy was beneath the dignity of the column.

W. F. MARNER.





archy gets a 50 per cent increase


Archy agreed this morning to return to work, for at least a week, pending a final adjustment of the difficulties between him and the column.

Archy’s demands were for a piece of apple pie once a week and for larger type for his contributions.

These demands will be considered in the final adjustment.

In the meantime, and pending the final adjustment, Archy returns on the basis of a 50 per cent increase in salary.


It is our contention that a 50 per cent increase is a very liberal increase, indeed, and that this temporary settlement should be a permanent settlement.

We admit that the public has been with Archy during the recent troubles. And it was only the pressure of public opinion that influenced us to take him back at all.

But, having decided that we must yield, we determined to come across handsomely.

THE 50 PER CENT INCREASE IN SALARY WAS OUR OWN SUGGESTION.

AND, ON OUR OWN INITIATIVE, WE HAVE MADE THIS INCREASE RETROACTIVE.

That is to say, not only does Archy get the 50 per cent increase during the week before the final adjustment, but we have volunteered to give it to him during the period covered by the strike, and for a term of two weeks prior to the strike.


SIR: Since Archy first became prominent as a literary bug, I have followed him through all his travels and adventures with fascinated interest. To me his vicissitudes have been a continuous source of enjoyment. And now that you have forced this poor downtrodden creature to abandon you to your own puny talents, may you live to regret it. Tomorrow when I open my paper, if Archy does not appear in the newspaper, I shall clip your column and burn it publicly with due and proper ceremony.—GUS.


We print, below, Archy’s own comment upon the temporary settlement:





comment from archy


well boss you see

where you stand now i hope the

public cannot get along

without me

i have won a moral victory

for you have agreed in

principle that i

should have a raise in

salary i will have to

think over it a

long time however before i

will consent to a 50 per cent

raise as a permanent settlement

and will have to take

advice it seems like a very

generous proposition on the

face of it but at the same time

i dont think it is

altogether right the figures look

good but i am puzzled you

see i was not getting any salary at

all when i quit work and if

i got a raise of

50 per cent above that the

question is what do i get

i would much rather have a

little something to eat every

week than all these figures but

at the same time i

must admit that a 50 per cent

raise looks good

on paper especially as you are

willing to make it

retroactive maybe the

retroactive part means that i

will get a little something

to eat at any rate it is easy

to see that i have won a most

important victory i would be willing

to make a permanent

settlement on the basis of

a 25 per cent increase and a half

a piece of pie i never was any good on

figures and maybe i am

getting a lot as it is but i

would rather have less

of a victory and more to eat

archy



We print this communication in full in order to show the public the difficulty we have with Archy. We have yielded in principle, we admit that he has won a victory, and we have given him a 50 per cent raise. It seems to me that we have done even more than could have been expected, but he seems dissatisfied. And yet he must know that he is in the wrong, for even while he talks of a moral victory he reduces his former outrageous demands for food by one half. He has been on the job without any food at all, so far as we know, for four years, and this sudden demand of his for something to eat does not have the ring of sincerity to our ears. What did he eat before he worked for the column? There is a strain of sordid materialism in Archy, we are afraid.

well i note you

put me back into nonpareil

again monday after raising me

to brevier all right boss

all right grind down

the laboring man there will come

a day of reckoning i dont have

to do this you know as far

as the food is concerned that

you have been giving me i lived before

i ever got into your column must close now

as mehitabel the cat is

scratching her claws against

the desk in a meaning sort of way

yours hastily

archy





a conversation with archy


insects and

the so called lower

animals have practically

no vices at all

as compared

with human beings

archy



Yes, yes, Archy; but does that prove the superiority of insects and the so-called lower animals? Or does it seem to point toward the necessity of vice in the evolutionary scheme? And to say “the necessity of vice” is to say “the necessity of morals”; for where there are no morals there is no vice.

well well

you do not feel

very sure of your

position or you would

not condescend to argue

about it with an insect

there is another thing

which i would like

to bring up

while we are talking

frankly to each other

and that is

the question of my raise

i returned to work faithfully

on the understanding

that i was to be fed

occasionally

but you never leave

anything on your desk any more

archy



We give you an opportunity to express yourself, and for the true artist that should be enough. You are always talking about your devotion to your art.

i want to be paid more

where would you be

if i left you flat

the only ideas

you ever had

you got from me

and after this i want

to appear in ten point

type

archy



After this you appear in minion type, or you don’t appear at all.

just listen to this then

this is my ultimatum

unless this piece

i am now writing

appears in ten point

type i will never

write another line

for you

archy



Just for that it goes in minion. And we are not afraid of your quitting us, again. We know that expression is the great need of your soul, and that rather than not get the publicity you would take it even in agate.

i want to say just

one more word before

i get through with you

forever

and that is that you

are a damned ingrate

i made you what you are

and this is the treatment

you give me

archy



That outburst of rebellion reduces you to nonpareil.

all right

good by forever

archy



You see what trying to bully us gets you! Your farewell is in agate. No cockroach can intimidate us! And if you ever come back into the column you come back in pearl type, and work your way up again. The suggestion of pay for contributions is repulsive and bolshevistic. Columns simply are not done that way.

well this goes into

brevier type instead of nonpareil

if you keep your promise thank

you for the raise in salary boss

but i find i have not

anything of great moment

to say how often that

happens when a man becomes

conspicuous he has used all

his best stuff winning fame in

small type or some other

inconspicuous way and in

poverty and obscurity has put his

soul into his work suddenly fame

and success come and he gets promoted

to big type on account of his

merits and lo and behold his

great thoughts desert him thank you

for the raise i hope the common fate

will not overtake me boss i will

strive to deserve the raise

hereafter

archy



lust for this, you go in agate, Archy.

see here boss i am no kicker nor

growler nor do i want more than is coming

to me but after raising me to brevier one

day you slammed me back into nonpareil

again what i want to know is this if you

think the stuff is rotten why do you

use it at all and if you think it is ok

why not give it a show here i am

trying to build up a public for

myself and you too and look at the

appreciation i get all right boss all right

but i warn you that you are queering your

own game i dont ask for brevier this time

but you might at least give me minion if

i make good in minion then raise me think

it over then think it over i am making no

threats of quitting but you think it over

archy



well boss i notice that

although you have taken me

back to work on my own terms

you are giving me no

work to do you always were jealous

of my popularity there

never has been a time since i made

my first appearance and

carried all before me that you

would not have gotten rid of

me if you had dared but

you have never dared

now you are giving me no work to do

in order to keep me

from my public you are

trying to ruin me why do

you not give me an

assignment now and

then

archy



If Archy cannot think up something to write about he can stay out of the column permanently. We are tired of giving Archy assignments that he can do easily and then having him take the credit for originality. The impression has gone abroad that not only does Archy think up his own themes, but that he also tells us what to write. The exact reverse of this is true. It is time that Archy, and his infatuated followers also, should understand that he is our subordinate, our creature. We admit that he has a certain superficial knack; but all the heavier, more solemn, respectable, and serious humor in the column is our own. His statement that he would like to work is entirely hypocritical. Since he won the strike he has done nothing but eat and sleep; he is gorged with food; between his triumph and his victuals he has become stupid. We knew food would ruin him, and it was in the interests of his literary ability, such as it is, that we kept him starved. Lord Tennyson noticed the same thing about a throstle … or maybe it was a blackbird. Anyhow, Lord Tennyson wrote a poem about it.… It was a bird that gorged itself and lived easy and ceased to be a poet. We have always thought it an indication of very high purpose and resolution that Lord Tennyson did not succumb himself in a similar manner; but after he became laureate he sang just as well as before. We believe that he was already laureate when he wrote “Come into the Garden, Maud.” Max Beerbohm has a cartoon of Lord Tennyson reading his poems to Queen Victoria in which the laureate looks both well fed and lyrical. We wish that Daisy Ashford’s Mr. Saltena had met a laureate at court and given us additional light upon this subject. But we still insist that in spite of Lord Tennyson’s experience, the rule holds good in the majority of cases; feed a poet and ruin him. The only thing that can save Archy now is a course of voluntary fasting, and we doubt that he has the will power for it. Give a cockroach enough jam and he will tangle his feet.





archy gets restless again


dear boss after thinking

over the terms of our temporary

settlement i

am forced to admit i

got the short end of the

deal you are a true diplomat and

a modest one at that but i want

you to know that your admission

to your readers in conceding me

a moral victory does not

suffice to fill an empty

stomach and nobody can work

without food so i am forced to

submit as the two chief subjects for

consideration in the final settlement the

necessity not only for deciding the

amount of salary but also a generous

allowance of food and good

food at that because since i

agreed to return to work i

met an old friend who took me to

a place where a lot of

nice people of the community

councils are distributing relief

food and by simply hiding in the

parcels that go out there are

lots of chances to get into all

kinds of fine homes we took a chance

and sneaked into one box of canned

goods and were placed in a fine

automobile that took us

to a swell house on the drive where

they have a pastry cook of their own and

we had the pastry all to our

selves and feasted on delicacies of

all sorts so half a piece of pie is

no longer any treat for me and

i can get acquainted with

some very aristocratic

cockroaches besides just by

attending food sales and i

am cultivating a taste for fancy

eatables that neither pie nor

25 per cent increase will satisfy

archy



It looks as if this Archy were getting ready to ask for more, no matter what we give him.

How human some cockroaches are!

say

maybe those guys

who are always

urging you

onward towards labor

and toil

and work and industry

just simply need

the money

your work produces

archy





seldom do i meet a person who will hold still long enough for me to get a meal

the cockroaches are not

the only insects

that are demanding more

consideration

i met a flea

last evening who

told me that he had come

into contact with

a great deal of unrest

lately and a mosquito remarked

to me only this

morning there is darned

little justice in this world the

way the human beings

run it seldom do i

meet a person who will hold

still long

enough for me to get a meal

archy





archy triumphs


thank you for the

advice to go and get

some of this

government food i do

not want to start all

over again

any controversy that has

been temporarily

settled but may i not

ask how

archy



well boss the time has

arrived for our permanent

settlement i propose

a plum plan

once a week i want a

pint jar of plum preserves

with bread and butter

and all the fixings that

go with them answer at once

i refuse to arbitrate

archy



We yield. We consider ourself lucky that Archy does not demand full ownership and control of the column. We yield while the yielding is still good.

boss i see by the

papers that there is

one income tax slacker who

owes 14 800 000 dollars lest

there be any possibility of

mistake i wish to state

publicly that i am not the

person the salary i receive for

my writings in the column

falls considerably below that

figure even in good

years yours for

vers libre as usual

archy





yes we have


i heard a good

story the other

day boss

i wonder if

you have heard it stop

me if you have wont you

it seems that

two cabbies in london

had had a bad day

it was raining

like anything and

neither one of them

had picked up a

fare in hours

have you heard it

they were driving along

side by side

bloodying their luck

when suddenly an old lady

came out of a house

and signaled to them

do you know it

they both stepped on the gas



neither of them had picked up a fare

and made

a mad dash for her

arriving at the same time

they drew

up before her

shes mine shouted one of

them at the top of his

lungs

im rotten at this

cockney dialect

like ell she

is shes mine hollered

the other

garn howled his rival

i seen the old bitch

first didnt i lady

archy





a wail from little archy


i can walk on six feet

or i can walk

on four feet

maybe if i tried hard enough

i could walk on two feet

but i cannot

walk on five feet

or on three feet

or any odd number of feet

it slews me around

so that i go catercornered

i mention this because

of my present

distressing condition

you have not fed

me lately let alone paying

me anything and

last night while eating

an apple core

in your waste paper basket

three of my feet

froze fast to it and are

useless at present writing

i wish you would

give me a set of galoshes

for my annual salary i

do not expect

real food from you any more

you always treat me

as if i were a constituent

and you were a politician

that my vote had just

elected to office

i dont know why i keep on

working for you

it is either a habit or a vice

archy





doing well


as i was

crawling through

a shoe store the

other day i

heard two pairs of shoes

talking to each other

well says the

first pair

you neednt feel

so smart

you have been

marked down from

twenty dollars to sixteen

while i have been marked

down from twenty one

dollars to

eighteen dollars

well said the

second pair i

make no claims to

superiority but

i will say i think

we are both doing

damned well for

five dollar shoes

archy





takes talent


there are two

kinds of human

beings in the world

so my observation

has told me

namely and to wit

as follows

firstly

those who

even though they

were to reveal

the secret of the universe

to you would fail

to impress you

with any sense

of the importance

of the news

and secondly

those who could

communicate to you

that they had

just purchased

ten cents worth

of paper napkins

and make you

thrill and vibrate

with the intelligence

archy





summer is icumen in


my scouts

from all over

the country tell

me that it is

getting along

towards the time

of year

when plump ladies

sit around

on the verandas

of summer hotels

and boarding houses

and swap

interesting yarns

about the times

they have been

under the knife

of the surgeon

archy





greetings old feather duster said i





archy climbs everest


may fifteenth nineteen

thirty five started climbing

mount everest early this morning

met the maharajah of nepal one hundred feet up

greetings old feather duster said i

that is not a feather duster he said

that is

stop i cried dont you tell me

that is your wife

that is my beard he said

i accept the apology i said

quick as a flash



may sixteen at one thousand feet

i met an avalanche coming down

as i was going up

we compromised and this morning

i am starting all over again

dancing on the avalanche

as it skidded towards sea level

were two strange figures

prancing on their hind legs

whom i identified as the dalai lama



mehitabel once was a Hindu nun

and mehitabel the cat

they were singing in part as follows

oh the lama here

is a son of a gun

and mehitabel once

was a hindu nun

skip skip my himalaya honey

the rarefied air

of the mountain side

has completely withered

the lamas pride

hike hike my himalaya honey

if the bottom of the hills

were placed at the top

when we wanted to go up

wed merely have to drop

drill drill my himalaya honey



may seventeen oh lord

the maharajah of nepal

is following me with a squirt gun

full of insect poison

here comes another avalanche

archy





archy on everest


may eighteenth fifteen

thousand feet up on mount

everest today i caught a ride

on an airplane going my way

everyone i meet is all hopped up

with the altitude

caught up with the maharajah of nepal

gaily hopping over the snow and ice

bare legged i said to him

hello spinach face are you starting

a nudist colony up here

and he replied

an avalanche

tore off my panche

and left me feeling funny

but we never rest

on everest

my himalaya honey

yes i says but who was that lady

i seen you walking with

a mile or so below

that wasnt no lady he says quick as a flash

that was the taj mahal

skipping along ahead of us were

the dalai lama and mehitabel the cat

mehitabel had written in the snow

send a message to my public

in america please archy give them

love and kittens from mehitabel

and the dalai lama

may nineteenth spent the day

riding up in airplanes

and coasting down on avalanches

if you dont know anything about asia

it would surprise you how much traffic

there is in the himalayas

may twentieth twenty thousand feet up

overtook a bum who says he is

nicholas romanoff formerly czar

of all the russias and when i say all

i mean all archy he said

the sun never set on my dominions

why not i asked him

because they were too cold

to hatch he replied ask me another

the reds missed me he said

and i have been in siberia ever since

i figure if i can get to the top

and stay there i will be safe

have you got a can opener

what for i enquired

i have some canned heat he said

but i cant get into it

i have practically lived on canned heat

ever since i escaped from russia

may twenty first got carried down

four thousand feet by a snow slide

when i came to myself

i was on a ledge of rock

and sitting in a row with their feet

hanging over nothing were mehitabel the cat

the dalai lama and the taj mahal

nicholas romanoff and the maharajah of nepal

all drinking canned heat and singing

in part as follows

we have tried all sorts

of winter sports

and spent a mint of money

we have skied the alps

and cracked our scalps

and burrowed like a bunny

but everest is sure the best

my himalaya honey

listen now said the former czar

and i will tell you the story of my life

it was going off of gold that ruined me

you mean the gold standard asked the lama

no said the maharajah

he means the gold cure

nevertheless said nicholas romanoff

i will tell you now the

story of my life

with slides asked the taj mahal

cant you try and forget it

mister romanoff asked the maharajah

no said the former czar

sniffing the canned heat

not while i have this rosemary

it is for remembrance

and he hit his insides

a terrific wallop with the horrid stuff

yes and rue is for you

said the taj mahal

kicking him five thousand feet downhill

and larkspur is for cooties

the dalai lama shouted

after him as he whirled into space

i discovered a virgin gold mine

the next morning how do you know

it is virgin asked mehitabel

yes said the taj mahal explain

tush tush said the dalai lama

give it the benefit of the doubt

well it seems reasonable said i

there is a snow slide

over it every twenty minutes

archy





and the result was hamlet





archy on the theater


Archy the Cockroach crawled into my office late the other night, scurried to my typewriter, and butted out the following ungenerous remark:

the theater is lousy

these days lousier than

it has been in three hundred years



“And what do you know about it?” I asked him.

i know everything about it

my ancestors have lived in theaters

for centuries

i am the repository of thousands

of generations of theatrical tradition

one of my ancestors was living

contentedly in a pile of old scripts

when a manager jerked one out

from underneath him one day

and handed it to a guy named shakespeare

and said bill get this old

junk into shape so we can

start rehearsals on it next tuesday

stick in a couple of murders

and some of your low browed comedy

and your smutty wisecracks

and philosophical hokum

and i dont need to tell you what to do

and the result was a play called hamlet

and another of my ancestors

was living in kit marlowes

fine elizabethan ruff

getting fat on starch

when marlowe was writing doctor faustus

my family has always lived around

theaters and theatrical hangouts

and one of my grandfathers grandfathers

used to live in edwin booths room

at the players club under the rug

and i repeat again that the theater

these days is lousy



“What’s the matter with it?” I asked him. And the insignificant insect replied, at length, as follows:

no glamour no illusion

that has all been thrown out of doors

and the movies have picked it up

and are doing the best they can with it

in their bungling way

the movies are struggling in a dumb headed

thumb handed way to give the public

some escape from the realities of life

and a glimpse into the fourth dimension

but the legitimate stage

goes right on presenting

stereotyped patterns of what is called

realism by which it means

the surface of the lives

of insignificant people

the reason the movies are doing business

and the theater is not

is not altogether one of price

or the financial condition of the country

the movies are young and crude

and are not afraid of gusto and the heroic

whether they sentimentalize

some lousy gunman and his doings

or put across an incredible western

or splurge with hokum melodrama

or embark on an adventure

of pure phantasy like wait disneys stuff

they are instinctively trying

to hand the public some kind of stuff

that wins the audience away from

the sordid surface of existence

they may do it badly

they may do it obviously

they may do it crudely

but they do have the hunch

that what the millions want is to be shown

that there is something possible

to the human race

besides the dull repetition

of the triviality which is the routine

of common existence



“You can certainly use some highbrow expressions, when you set yourself to it, Archy,” I said to the incredible cockroach. But the conceited insect kept right on butting his opinions out on the keyboard.

the legitimate stage

is afraid of ranting

the legitimate stage is afraid

of any breadth of gesture

the legitimate stage is afraid

of being kidded if it puts across

a genuine fervor of emotion

it is all tightened up and narrowed down

by its various fears

but the movies from the start

have had to please the millions

in order to exist in a business way

and they have had to keep in touch

with the mind of the mob

and the mob always wants a hero in a story

with whom it can identify itself

in some attempt to break through

into a better condition of existence

the great fault of the movies

has also been their great virtue

that is their necessity to cater to millions

it has compelled them to keep in touch

with the modern equivalent of folk lore

every now and then they have blundered

into doing something with a touch

of the universal in it just

because they follow ignorantly

this instinctive hunch of theirs



Archy ceased to write, and held his head with four of his feet. I thought he was grieving for the condition of the theater, and asked him if this was the case.

no he said

the theater has deserted me

and i am willing to let it go

it saddens me a little to think

that thousands of generations of us

devoted cockroaches are left in the lurch

but the fact is that the legit stage

is no longer the theater in a big way

the moving picture is the theater now

the living and real theater





archy flies


well boss i have had

some experiences you know that

fellow with the teeth that glitter

and the eyes that glitter who

comes in to see you and

who has been talking about his aeroplane

for six months you thought he

was always a liar and

so did i he is the kind of a liar who

looks so much like a liar no one

believes him when he tells the

truth i thought i would call

his bluff so i crawled into

his outside breast pocket the other day

and went out to a place near mineola

with him he really has an aeroplane he

went up in it the next morning and

i went along boss i must have

picked out the wrong position i sat

on top of one of the planes thinking i would see

more of the country boss

dont ask me for any sensations the

only thing i felt was wind i felt

like a sigh in a cyclone i had

about as much control of myself as a

bullet that is going through the

barrel of an airgun i dont want

to rub anything in boss but it

was as hard to hang onto as the water

wagon which is a simile

you may be able to appreciate i



i must have picked out the wrong position

dug all my feet and claws

and teeth in but the wind rushed by

me like a church scandal going

through a little village i would have

felt nausea if

my stomach hadnt been scared to death

it was only a question of time before i

would let loose thank heaven i thought i am

not an elephant i didnt

want to die again so soon just because

i can come to life again is

no reason for overworking a good thing too

many deaths and transmigrations look

vulgar and ostentatious

and when i did let go i must have

been two miles high around and

around i spun whirling like a flake of

soot that has been flipped

off of a devils wing between the

worlds and is spinning back home to

hell and beneath me it looked

like hell there was a vast expanse of water

with the sun making it

seem like melted metal i suppose i said

i will get all my feet wet now and

take my death of cold if a fish

dont eat me and just then i saw

beneath me a great fish grinning as if

he had heard a joke on the

bottom of the sea and come up to

laugh at the cosmos get that

cosmic stuff boss it goes great in some

circles i lit on one of his great white teeth

and waited for the gulp that should land

me in his interior department oh

lord i said if i ever see dry land i

will never mock at that jonah story

again i dont want to die in

midocean and be reincarnated as a

sardine or as an oyster

a cockroach isnt much but

he has a look in in society where

an oyster is never mentioned except as an

article of food but if it

must be it must be kismet and karma and

that bunch of bullies vote us the way they

please we are only instructed delegates

in the universal convention every

time i die it makes me more of a fatalist and

i waited for him to gulp but

he didnt gulp i hopped over to

the next tooth to the right as you go in

and investigated and finally climbed

out where his upper lip would have been if he had

had one and worked up to his eye it was

glassy in death i was floating on a dead shark

and it was all the more unpleasant

because he had not had any dental work done for a

long time or else he had adenoids or maybe

he had died of ptomaine poisoning boss what i am

delicately trying to convey is

that he had been dead so long he had a right to

be ashamed of it just then i

heard human voices and looking around i saw

two young men in bathing suits and

a motor boat a shark a shark cried one

of them put her about the motor is still

busted said the other row row for your

life but wait said the first one this

shark seems deceased bill lets haul him to land

and say we slew him right o torn says

bill it will make a hit with all the girls he

attacked us says torn and i jumped into the water and

cut his throat with my jackknife you

did eh says bill what was i doing then put two

slashes into him which they did one for each and

fastened him to the stern of their boat with a

line and as they towed him to the beach with

me sitting listening they fixed

up an awful lie talk about ovations boss when they

came to the beach they got one the

more i see of human nature the less i know

whether to despise it for being so easily

gulled or for being so ready to

gull by the time they had told

that story eight times each believed that

he was telling the truth although he

still thought maybe the other one was lying well

i left those two heroes

surrounded six deep by girls and came to

town in a little bunch of dress goods samples a

commuters wife has been trying to make

him remember to match my

sympathies being with the shark poor feeble old

thing he had likely perished of old age

to be killed a second time is hard luck but

this is the truth of a story that you

may read another version of in

the news columns

archy





archy and the suicide


well boss i have just

been assisting at a suicide i think the

gentleman who killed himself was

quite right in doing so too

i went into the kitchen of an

up town hotel the other

evening for a bite to eat and after

i had dined i thought

i would look the place over and if

i found a room that appealed to me i

would spend the night there

the room i got into was already

infested by a little old bald headed fellow

with scared eyes and a face like

a petrified turnip who was

hunched up under a reading lamp

reading a

bible all of a sudden he gave a

jump and said gawd gawd there it

is again and i saw a puff of

smoke floating across the

table in front of him it seemed to come

from nowhere in particular smoke

smoke cried the old man i am

haunted by smoke and as

he spoke another puff of smoke

suddenly appeared from nowhere on

the table in front of him

gawd gawd he cried spare me spare

me do not persecute me this way

and i will give all the money to charity

i will give it to the red

cross or any church you

may designate i know

i did wrong to burn down that

building for the

insurance money but how was i

to know there was any one in it i

did not plan a murder a third

puff of smoke seemed to start out of

his own shoulder and floated in

front of his eyes and a fourth

puff hit him on his bald head and made

a little veil in front of his face

gawd gawd he cried and threw

himself on the rug and began to

pray with his face hidden i

thought to myself those

puffs of smoke are peculiar there

isnt anything on fire in

here and then i got a whiff of it

and it smelled like tobacco smoke

then i saw something that looked

like a gray globe floating from the

direction of the bathroom door it

drifted across the room and hit

the reading lamp and vanished with a

puff of smoke i looked at the

bathroom door and i thought i

heard some one chuckle over there and

then i saw another gray globe of smoke forming

at the keyhole it slowly grew and grew till it

was as big as a baseball and then it

detached itself from the door and

floated across the room

i crawled noiselessly under the bath

room door it was one of those bath

rooms midway between two sleeping

rooms and there were a couple of

chuckle headed young fellows sitting

on the floor laughing to

themselves both were about half

soused and they were having a good

time one of them had a slender hollow

brass curtain rod and he was soaping

the end of it and

sticking it into the keyhole then he

would fill his mouth with cigarette

smoke and blow a soap bubble which

drifted into the old mans room what

is he doing now said one of them he

is on the floor praying said the

other taking the rod out of the

keyhole and looking through let me

blow a couple said the first young

man you are too soused said the

second one dont be selfish said the

first one gawd gawd said the voice

from the room i had just left i am

haunted by ghostly smoke i will live

right all the rest of my life if you

only let me off this time

give him another bubble said the

first young man he has got it

coming to him evidently so

they gave him half a dozen more

bubbles the noise

in the haunted mans room ceased for

some minutes what is he doing now

said the first young man i cant see

him said the second one just then

there came a kicking kind of a noise

on the wall i went into the

haunted mans room and found his

closet door was open i went in and he

was just dying he had hanged himself

to a hook on the wall with a trunk

cord those two young fellows had

just the wrong man for their little

practical joke or

just the right man if you want to

look at it that way i

went away from there at once not

wishing to be on hand if there

was any investigation yours

for conscience and coincidence

and may they never meet

archy





and found out too late





comforting thoughts


a fish who had

swallowed an angle worm

found all too late

that a hook was nesting

in its midst ah me

said the poor fish

i am the most luckless

creature in the world

had you not pointed

that out said the worm

j might have supposed

myself a trifle

unfortunate

cheer up you two said

the fisherman jovially

the first two minutes

of that hook are always

the worst you must

cultivate a philosophic

state of mind

boss there is always

a comforting thought

in time of trouble when

it is not our trouble

archy





inspiration


excuse me if my

writing is out of alignment i

fell into a bowl of

egg nog the other

day at the restaurant down

the street which the doctor

says he is glad to

hear you are keeping away

from and when i

emerged i was full of happy

inspirations alas they

vanished ere the break of

day i am sure they

were the most brilliant and

witty things that ever

emanated from the mind of

man or cockroach or poet i

sat inside a mince pie

and laughed and laughed at

them myself the world seemed all

one golden glory boss

i came up the

street to get all this

wonderful stuff onto paper for

you but when i tried to

operate the typewriter

my foot would slip and

by the time i had control

of the machine again

the thoughts had gone

forever it is the

tragedy of the artist

archy





gossip


well boss it is

surprising how many

gossips there are left in

this world and how

easy it is to ruin a

person s reputation

a few days ago an

alleged friend of yours

remarked to another

alleged friend i saw

archy on a bun in

a cafe down town the other

day and the second alleged

friend told another person

that archy had been seen

publicly intoxicated and

the other person went

around saying poor

archy he drinks like a

water bug until my

reputation is ruined you

would think i was

the habitual companion of

the well known dipsas snake

and the truth of

the whole thing is very

simple your alleged friend did

see me on a bun

in a cafe it was a

common ordinary bun such as

you spread butter on

and eat and i

was eating at it

just as i would sit on any other

piece of bread and eat but

now all my friends are

saying to me

did i see you on a

bun or did i not

answer yes or no and if i

answer no they say

prevaricator i saw you on a

bun and if i answer yes they

say i thought so and

will not let me explain and

if i do not answer

at all they say

aha too full for

utterance sometimes i

bate the world

archy





a close call


thank you boss for the

swiss cheese i hardly hoped

for a whole one i

took up quarters in it at once

the little galleries and caves and

runways appealed to

my sense of adventure after

i had made a square

meal i lay down in the inner

chamber for a nap feeling

safe i had hardly composed my limbs

for slumber when i heard

a gnawing sound and squeaks

of glee cautiously i

approached the north gallery a mouse

was there i hastily

retreated thinking i would make

my escape by way of one of the

windows on the south facade another

mouse was there the citadel

in short was attacked on all sides mice

mice mice coming nearer and nearer

their cold blooded squeaks and the champing

of their cruel teeth made the night

hideous minute after minute i lay

in the stokehold

until the slow minutes grew into

intolerable hours of agony great drops

of perspiration broke through the callus

on my brow i prayed for

dawn or the night watchman suddenly

into my retreat protruded a whisker it

was so near it tickled me closer and

closer it came it twitched i knew

that it had felt me a moment more and

all would be over just as

i prepared myself for another

transmigration mehitabel the cat

bounded into the room and i was saved

if you get me another cheese please

put a wire cage over it

archy





kidding the boss


well boss if i

were you i would not

put too much

trust in the

candor of those people

who tell you that you

will ever learn to

play kelley pool a

cockroach who lives

in one of the

pockets of the

pool table of that place

where you are so

often inveigled into playing

tells me that he

has never yet had to

dodge a ball that

you hit he sticks his

head out of his dugout

and watches the

game in perfect security

while you are shooting he

says it is a shame

the way you fall for the

flattery of those who

tell you that you are

improving my only

interest in the

matter is connected

with the fact that if

you wasted less

money on what will

always remain a game of

chance to you

you might be able to

do the square thing by

me and slip a

little money my way

now and then

for my contributions

archy





a sermon


well boss here

we are on the job again

you simply cannot

keep a good bug down

as a cockroach friend

of mine once

remarked to a fat man

who had

inadvertently

swallowed him along

with a portion

of hungarian goulash

although the remark

i understand

originated with jonah

well the main

thing is to keep

cheerful in spite

of the ups and

downs as i

heard an oyster

remark to his mate

last evening

only six weeks till

may says he

and if we go that long

without being eaten

we will get through

till September and

maybe by that time

nobody will want to

eat us no such

luck for us says

she nonsense says

he be more optimistic

i have noticed

every year that if

i get through

march i always

get through the rest

of the year

and just at that

moment a waiter

put the melancholy

oyster on a plate to

be served and eaten

and rejected the

cheerful oyster

there is a great

moral lesson

in this i pick

up a great many

little sermons of this

sort in my capacity as a

roach about town

difficulties of art


boss why dont you get a

ribbon put into your typewriter it is only

after the most desperate exertions that

i am able to pound out these few lines i

had to get a sheet of carbon paper

and insert it between two sheets of white paper

and fix it in the machine in order to

write at all and would never have got it

done if it hadnt been that mehitabel the

cat and all the rest of the gang

around here helped me i had something

important i wanted to write you but all this

frightful physical labor has driven it out

of my mind it is always so with the

artist by the time he has overcome the

difficulties that lie between him and

his masterpiece

he is tired i wish you would get me an

electric typewriter and why not have me

endowed so i would not have to worry about

material things at all i would like to write

and eat and sleep and not work at anything else

We said to Archy the other day: “You are welcome to our house any time you wish, if you come alone. But please cease bringing your friends and kinsfolk with you.” To which he replied:

boss

you should have learned

by this time

that literature

makes strange

bedfellows





the captain s little golden headed daughter flung crumbs to the hungry porpoises





a spiggoty hero


i met a big spiggoty cockroach

down by one of the

docks where the fruit steamships come in

the other day who says he

is quite a hero

the deed he did will soon be

shown in the movies he thinks for

he is certain that a camera

man was present

an american battleship was going through

one of the locks of the

panama canal he says and

the captain s little golden

headed daughter was sitting in the

bows flinging crumbs from a sea

biscuit to the hungry porpoises

which flocked about the vessel when

in hurling a large crumb she lost her

balance and fell overboard the

old lock keeper immediately became rattled the

ship was half way through the gate when

the child fell among the

porpoises and the old lock keeper

saw her fall and let

loose of the lever

the ponderous gates were swinging shut and

both the battleship and the

little golden haired girl would

have been caught between them and

pinched into nothingness if

this spiggoty cockroach

according to his story had not retained his

presence of mind

he gave one leap he says and landed

on one of the cog wheels that

are worked by the old lock keeper s lever

he braced himself between a cog on one

wheel and a cog on the other and

exerted all his strength and in

an instant the machinery was stopped because

the wheels could no longer revolve he

made himself a wedge he says

it was a great strain he says and the

pressure on his forehead and feet was

something frightful the old lock keeper

plunged in among the porpoises and handed up

the little golden haired girl

to the ship and just then the captain of

the vessel noticed that the

heroic cockroach was weakening and hastily

sent a cabin boy to find a

bootjack which when found

he inserted among the cogs thus

releasing the heroic cockroach who fell

unconscious to the deck of the vessel the

old lock keeper returned to his duty grasped the

lever again and the bootjack was

removed the ship sailing onward happy

and safe the captain insisted on decorating

him in front of the crew for his

heroism he would have shown me the decorations

he said but on his way north he

was very hungry and ate them up

in his sleep one night he dreamed he

was eating he says and when he woke at

dawn he found the decorations had

disappeared but he did show me the scars

on his forehead and feet to

prove his story i will not say there

was rum on the ship that he came north on but

i will say that there was

something that did not smell quite like

molasses on his breath as he talked to me and i

should like to see the movie

films before i underwrite the story i told

him so and he acted sad and

injured if i had been lying he said i

could have thought of a better lie than

that something more picturesque i would have

said that the old lock keepers whiskers got caught

in the cog wheels and he was

being slowly drawn into the

machinery and would have

died a horrible death and that i

rescued him as well as the little

girl and the battleship well we went

down the street and met another

roach a friend of mine and this

spiggoty told the story to him and when he

told it he said that the old

lock keepers whiskers had been caught and

so forth

and showed a gray horsehair he had

picked up on the street a moment before and

said it was a hair from the old

lock keepers beard which he

had given him as a keepsake in

vino veritas may be right but rum if

it was rum i smelled seems to work

differently

archy





sociological


when the cold weather

comes i always

get a new interest in sociology

i am almost human that way

it worries me as to how

the other half

are going to get through

the winter

last evening i went

into a cheap eating house

and dropped into a beef stew

and had a warm bath

and a bite to eat

and listened afterwards

to a couple of bums

who had begged enough

during the day to get a supper

they were talking

about this new movement

on the part of the jobless

and homeless

to take possession of the churches

and live there during

the cold weather

said the first bum

i dont think i could do it

it would bring up

too many associations

you see i am a minister s son

you too exclaimed the second bum

why i also

am the son of a preacher

my father was a minister

in small towns all his life

he worked himself to death at it

he never got paid enough

to live on

and it was not until i left home

and became a hobo that i ever

got as much as i wanted to eat

at one meal

precisely my experience

said the other bum

have you ever had any temptation

said number one

to quit being a hobo

and take a regular job

yes said number two

very often

but i have always had

the strength of character

to resist temptation

it is my duty to my fellow men

to see that they have

material on which to wreak

their passion to be charitable

during the christmas holidays

it makes the well to do

more comfortable and gives

them a warm virtuous glow

when they give me a dime

and i should not feel justified

in taking from them

such a simple and inexpensive pleasure

yes said the other bum

the rich we have always with us

they are the great problem of the age

we must treat them as well

as we can and help them

to have a little fun by the way

so that they can forget

at least temporarily

the biblical assurance

that it is as hard for them to enter

the kingdom of heaven

as for a camel

to pass through a needle s eye

well said the other one

sometimes i think i would

be willing to change places

with a rich man

and run the risk

oh certainly said the other

i have never had any instinctive

hatred for riches

it is only work that i detest

riches are all very well

if you inherit them

but i doubt if they are worth

toiling for

think of all the millions

toiling miserably in order

to be damned

it is a pathetic sight

but if one inherits riches

he knows that the fates

have doomed him to be damned

before his birth

and it is of little use to struggle

that is far different from striving

desperately all one s life

to lay up enough wealth

to damn one

i perceive said his new found friend

that your early training

has stayed by you

you have a truly religious nature

yes replied the other

at the cost of great

personal sacrifice in many ways

i have kept myself

an object of charity

in order to foster

the spirituality of the well to do

the most passionate piety

could do but little more

but if you had inherited

great riches said the other bum

would you have given them to the poor

i doubt was the reply

that i would have felt justified

in doing that

i would more likely have said to myself

that providence

had by that token

marked me out as one destined

to hell fire

and i would have considered it

impious to struggle against

the manifest wishes of heaven

well sighed the other

life is full of terrible problems

indeed it is

rejoined his friend

but i am afraid that i shall

never solve even the least of them

when i am empty and cold

i am not in the mood for meditation

and when i am warm and replete

i go to sleep

the few guiding principles

i learned in father s church

have carried me thus far

and i shall go on to the end

never thinking beyond them

i merely apply them literally

and they work

they have made me what i am

he concluded complacently

archy





never blame the booze


as i go up and down the town

hither to and fro i gather many a

smile and frown and talk of

thus and so i lately

listened and i heard two chaps

their luck bewail life did not get

a pleasant word they

told an awful tale for one of them

had just been fired he

glummed and wondered why he cried

into his beer

aspired

to punch the boss his eye too

true the other one exclaimed this

world s a burning shame the

game of living has been framed it is

a rotten game and ever as they railed

at fate and wooed the sombre muse

they steadily absorbed a great

sufficiency of booze but neither one

that cursed his luck and beat his burning bean

would blame the downfall on the truck

that passed his lips between

and as i listened there i thought it were

more candid far to give its dues to what they bought

across the varnished bar they should indeed

be far more frank about their hard lucks boss

they should remark

each genial tank unto their bosses faces

you can t expect a man to drink as much as i do boss

and have much time to work and think

and put the job across

oh boss you ask too much of me

i do the best i can but who can lush

continually and be a working man

you can t expect a man to booze from morning

until night and feel quite nimble

in his shoes and add his figures right oh boss

you ask too much of us we have no flair for toil

we d rather daily dally thus imbibing joyful oil

you can t expect a man to souse

and do work for your business house so do not be unjust

twere more like reason if they said such words

unto their bosses than tear the hair

and beat the head and blame luck

for their losses

archy





the sad crickets


well boss it may

surprise you to learn

that a cricket does not

sing to be cheerful

as chas dickens believed

he sings because he

feels so melancholy i

asked one with whom

i have become well

acquainted what his song

meant and he

replied

there are no words

to go with

that music but the

music is sad i

make that music these

hot nights because i

have prickly heat

and there is nothing else

to do and another

cricket said yes

our song is sad i am

not troubled by the

heat but my song is

melancholy too the words to

my song said the second

cricket are as follows

and he repeated them for

me to wit

my love fell into a spiders web

squeak squeak squeak

and she screamed with pain as he

crunched her bones into his

bloody beak squeak squeak

squeak yes i said that is

sad very sad said the

cricket but not as sad as the

second stanza which goes

as follows my love got caught in

the crack of the door squeak

squeak squeak and i think with

grief of the way she died whenever

i hear it creak

squeak squeak squeak

whenever i hear it creak

squeak squeak squeak

that brings tears to my eyes

i said yes he said

there is nothing you could call

jolly about the

second stanza nor the

third fourth and fifth stanzas

friend i said

hurriedly let me hear the

last stanza

he looked at me as if

i had struck him

and hurried off with

tears in his gentle eyes

one thing that

makes crickets so

melancholy is that

they have the artistic

temperament

archy





fond recollections


boss i saw a

pitiful sight yesterday i

was crawling across the

ruins of an old house that

the workmen are tearing

down up town and

i saw a middle

aged man sitting on a

pile of bricks with

his gray hair in his hands he

was weeping and moaning

and i gathered from his

remarks that the place was once

a boarding house where

he had spent

many happy years i caught

a few strophes of his

song of woe as

follows

o workman spare that bathtub o

that bathtub made of zinc

that bathtub in the boarding house

that i lived in for years

fond recollections of

my youth surge oer

me when i think

upon that bathtub in that

boarding house and i

choke up with tears

when splashing of a Sunday

morn a peevish voice and surly

would tell me to make

haste and be

myself again adorning

throughout the week it

had few friends

but o on sunday morning

that bathtub in the

boarding house was

busy bright and early

how well i can remember how

as i tripped down the hall

the boarders heads would

be poked out along the

corridor

the sound of some one singing

upon my ears would fall

and sounds of others waiting

and getting very sore

o workman spare that

bathtub to me it does

bring back

the merry days when i was

young and all the world was pink

o workman spare that bathtub

from ruin and from rack

the bathtub in the

boarding house

the bathtub made of zinc

immorality


i was up to central

park yesterday watching some

kids build a snow man when

they were done and had

gone away i looked it

over they had used two

little chunks of wood for

the eyes i sat on one

of these and stared at

the bystanders along came a

prudish looking

lady from flatbush she

stopped and regarded the

snow man i stood

up on my hind legs in

the eye socket and

waved myself at her

horrors she cried even the

snow men in manhattan

are immoral officer arrest

that statue it winked

at me madam said the cop

accept the tribute

as a christmas present

and be happy my own

belief is that some

people have immorality

on the brain

archy





archy is excited


dear boss i am

acquiring more

and more contempt

for you humans

i heard a couple

of girls yesterday

saying what a nice

christmas present it

would make to catch

a live archy

and have him gilded and

wear him on

attached to a scarf

ive got just one

resolution for this year boss

and here it is

better stuff and more rhymes

what have i got to look

forward to otherwise if

a vers libre poet is

reincarnated into

a cockroach what will

a vers libre cockroach

be reincarnated into i

ask you

i don t want to be

a amoeba next time do i

i sing the glad noo year

thats tending toward the norm

my song is one of cheer

im going to reform

archy says


i suppose the human race

is doing the best it can

but hells bells thats

only an explanation

its not an excuse



i heard a dry telling a flapper

the other day that since repeal

the women are drinking

too much gin

and the young lady

thoughtfully replied o nerts

there aint too much gin

there aint hardly enough



mehitabel the cat

was running around with a torn cat

off a cruiser when the fleet

was in new york

and she said to me yesterday

archy i wish you would come

down to shinbone alley

and see the seven funny little

sea serpents yowling around there

trying to put it across on me

that i am their parent

every time i go in for

a platonic friendship





there aint too much gin there aint hardly enough

it turns out plutonic

my maternal instinct

has proved to be a great drawback

it started when i was practically

a debutante and has been going

from bad to worse ever since



my ideals are putty

your ikons made of mud

and so you think me nutty

and i think youre a dud

with germs you must excuse me

one must draw the line somewhere

these friends of yours look

like alien enemies to me they

may have noble names but

their blood is thin

so i left

him flat and dropped into

a beef steak pie in one

of these arm chair restaurants for

a bite to eat and a

warm bath before

going to bed

that book worm was

out for some wild

the last few days have

you seen the comet

and my answer has been

seen it why

i rode on it

that is how i got

back here after my

travels it is my private

comet i park

it up there and it

time to hustle up any

grub for myself wont

you please leave

something behind the radiator it has

been three days since i ate i might

have dined on an apple core last night

in a restaurant uptown

i dropped into a beef stew

yesterday for a warm bath

and a bite to eat

and i heard a horrid discussion

between a waiter and a customer

they were talking about fishing

and the customer says the best luck

he ever had was one time when he

was staying at a run down hotel

in the country and he used cockroaches for bait

the waiter made a note

and says he is going to write

to a rod and gun column in a paper about it

yes says the customer do so and i bet you

in a year from now

they won t be using anything but cockroaches

and they will be worth almost

their weight in gold

boss please petition congress at once

and get a law passed

against cruel and unusual bait

after all i have done for this country

am i to be in danger

of getting the hook like that

if you abolish the cockroaches

no boarding house will seem like home

and no home like a boarding house

why i have lived in places

which would have fallen down

if the spider webs and cockroaches

had been removed

i consider fishing a barbarous sport anyhow

archy

well boss on these

rainy days i wish i was

web footed like a jersey mosquito no

one has yet invented

an umbrella for cockroaches i was

over across the street

to the barroom you used to

frequent before you reformed today

and it was raining outside i

pulled a piece of cheese

rind over my head to

protect me from the weather and

started for the door as i

passed by one of the booths a man

who was sitting in it said to

his companion please call a

taxi for me where do you want to go

said his companion i am

bad again said the man i want to

go to some place where they

treat nervous diseases

at once you look all right

said his companion i may look all

right said he but i don t see

all right i just saw a piece

of cheese rind crawling along the

floor and as i passed by i

said to myself beware the demon rum

it gives your brain a quirk

it puts you on the bum

and gives the doctors work

ancient lineage


professor slosson

says that the cockroach

is one of the eldest of the

creatures that inhabit

the globe

two hundred and fifty

millions of years

ago the cockroach

existed just as he exists

today of course it is

very flattering

to have this scientific

testimony to my ancient

lineage i can trace my

ancestry back without

a break to old adam cockroach

himself but the real question is

how much has the cockroach

learned in two hundred and

fifty million of years

well i can tell you

in a few brief words

the cockroach has learned

how to make man

the so called lord

of creation work for him

the cockroach lives

in peace and plenty

while the human race

hustles to support him

all the social institutions

of all time have existed

merely for the purpose

of forming a pyramid

on the apex of which

perches the cockroach triumphant

it has taken us a long

time but we point

with pride to the achievement

quaint


“Does Archy ever visit Greenwich Village?” asks R.P. “I found myself in company with a cockroach of a dissipated but still scholarly appearance in one of the cafés over there the other evening.…”

Archy, we regret to say, will frequent the Village. Indeed, we hear that he is planning to open a café of his own to be known as “Ye Crusty Cockroach.”

“But why the ‘Ye,’ Archy?” we asked him. “Why not merely ‘The’?”

And Archy, loping six-leggedly to the typewriter, laboriously replied:

it is going to be one

of those quaint

places boss and all those

quaint places have to

be ye instead of the

in a ye place you can

serve almost anything

and get away

with it but in a

the place you have to

have a certain amount

of eats and drinks

and that increases the

expense of operation

enormously i am no

pig but i do wish to

make enough money once in

my life to be

among the

excess prophets or the

excise profits or

what ever you call

them



For our part, we shall never eat goulash in a place that is conducted by Archy—so many of these Greenwich Village artists are always Putting Themselves Into Their Work.





the artist


i called on some friends in a

studio building the other evening and

while we were foraging about

for something to eat

we got caught on a

palette smeared over with all

the colors there are

leaping from this danger seven

or eight of us

landed upon an untouched canvas

that stood upon an easel

nearby waiting for the masters hand

and we walked across the

canvas on our way out of that

place it seems that we builded

better than we knew before

we could get to any safer place

than a spot behind a

gas radiator we heard human footsteps

approaching and an

instant later two men entered the

studio one of them switched on

the lights and the

other gave an exclamation of

pleasure and astonishment by jove

tommy he said to the owner of

the studio what is this new thing

of yours on the easel it is

the best thing you have done yet

i thought you were against

modernism and all

the new fangled stuff but i see

that you have come over to the new

school your style has

loosened up wonderfully old kid

i always said that if you

could only get away from the stiffness

and absurdity of the

conventional schools you had the

makings of a great painter in

you what do you call this

picture tommy

well said tommy with rare

presence of mind i have not

named it yet it is not altogether in

the newer mode you will observe i

have been struggling for a

compromise between the two methods

that would at the same time

allow me to express my

individuality on canvas i do

think myself that i have got more

freshness and directness into this

thing you have said his friend

it has the direct and naive approach

of the primitives and it

also has all that is

worthy to be retained of the

reticent sophistication of

the post pre raphaelites but what

do you say you are going to

call it it is said tommy as

you see a nocturne i have

been thinking of calling it

impressions of brooklyn

bridge in a fog and when his

friend went out he stood and looked at

the picture for a long time and

said now i wonder who in

hell slipped in here and did that it

is nothing short of genius could

i have done it myself when i

was drunk i must have done so

anyhow i will sign it and

taking up a brush he did so well i

stole a look at the canvas

myself and it looked like nothing

on earth to me but a canvas over

which a lot of cockroaches had

walked i may be a

critic but still i know what i

dont like yours for another

spring and every autumn

the suicide club


boss i ran onto a queer bunch

in the back room of a saloon on william street

the other night there were six of them

two cockroaches

a grass hopper

a flea

and two crickets

they have what they call a suicide club

not the sort our old

friend r l s made famous

the members of which intend to kill

themselves but each member of this

club has committed suicide already

they were once humans

as i was myself

at least i was a poet

after they killed themselves their souls

transmigrated into the bodies

of the insects mentioned

and so they have got together and

formed a club the other night the grass



just as i got my shoe off we passed a glue factory

hopper told why he had killed himself

it was a misunderstanding

with one i loved he said

which impelled me to the rash act

she and i were walking down a country

road and i got some gravel in one

of my shoes shortly afterward we

boarded a trolley car would you

mind i asked her if i took my shoe off

and shook out the gravel

help yourself she said

just as i got my shoe off we passed

a glue factory

i hastily put the shoe on again by the

time it was on again we were well past

the glue factory

the period during which the shoe was off

and the period during which we

were passing the glue factory exactly

synchronized

she did not see the glue factory

and refused to believe there had been

one in the neighborhood i could

never explain a month later

i killed myself tough luck

old top said the flea i will now

tell you why i took the fatal

plunge i will

tell you how it was i

committed suicide and transmigrated

into the body of an insect i was

the india rubber man in a circus side

show and fell in love with a

pair of beautiful Siamese twins

public opinion was against

me marrying both of them

although both of them loved me as i

loved them both you

must choose between them said the

manager what god has joined together

let no man put asunder i said but

public opinion was too much for me

but the surgical operation which

severed them changed their

dispositions you cant fool with

a freak without running some such

risk when they were cut apart one of

them eloped with the surgeon

who had done the work and the other

married an interne in the

hospital they had a double

wedding and i slew myself that night

well said one of the crickets i will

now tell you how i shuffled off

this mortal coil and

transmigrated into the

body of a cricket and became a

member of this has been club my father

belonged to a religious sect which

forbids shaving and i was

brought up in that way no

razor ever touched my face when i was

forty years old i had a beard that hung

down to my knees it was red and

glossy i went around the country

posing as a doctor for a medicine

company hitting the tank towns in a

wagon and giving a spiel and

playing on the banjo i did well as

my beard attracted

crowds and was happy and

prosperous until one day a

malignant old man who

had just bought six bottles of tonic

for five dollars made of roots herbs

and natures own remedies

containing no

mineral ingredients and brewed from

juniper leaves hazel roots choke

cherries and the bark of the

wild cohosh exactly

as the indians made it for a

thousand years

in the unpathed forests before the

pale face came said to me mister

can i ask you a question yes i

said i have nothing to conceal i am on

the level if one wine glass full before

meals does not give you an appetite

take two or three

mister he says the question is

personal go ahead i says i am the

seventh son

of a seventh son a soothsayer and a

seer i can tell by the way

you chew tobacco you have liver

trouble i will make a

special price to you fourteen

bottles for ten dollars cash no he said

it is about your beard it grew i told

him through using this medicine

my chin was bald at

birth it is a specific for erysipelas

botts neuralgia stomach trouble loss

of appetite hearts disease dandruff and

falling hair thirty bottles to you

for twenty dollars and i will throw

in an electric belt

mister he said i only want to ask

you if you sleep

with all your beard outside

of the covers or

under the covers when you go to

bed at night and he gave me an evil

grin and went on i

never thought of it

before i had just gone to bed and slept

as a rule but that night when i

climbed into bed i thought of the old

mans question i spread all my

beard outside of the covers and it

was immediately apparent to me

that i did not have the habit of

sleeping with it that way then i put it

under the covers and was

no less certain that i did not

sleep with it that way i worried

about it till morning and each way i

put it seemed at

once to be the wrong way

the next night it was the same

thing i could not keep from

thinking about it i got no sleep at all

and became the mere shadow of my

former self it so preyed upon me

that at last i saw i must either

shave off the beard or end it all but i

could not shave off the beard

without deserting the religious principles

instilled into me by my father and so i

took the fatal plunge hard lines said the

second cricket the way i happened to

commit suicide and undergo

transmigration and

thus qualify for a member of this club

was this when i was a

human i was wedded to a lady whose

mother had a very strong

and domineering character she

lived with us night after

night i would lie awake thinking

up schemes to get even

with her i thought up

some lovely schemes but when

morning came my nerve would

leave i never had the courage to

put them into execution finally

the thought came to me that if i was

a ghost i could haunt her and

she would have no come back i slew

myself but alas my soul transmigrated

into the body of a cricket and

if you had ever seen that strong and

bitter old woman slaying spiders and

crickets you could realize

the despair that has settled down on me

since too bad said one

of the cockroaches i will now narrate the

events which led up to my

determination to

take the leap into the

darkness

i cant say that i

had any good reason for

slaying myself i had done everything

else at least once i was a

young man possessed of a

considerable fortune which it was my only

occupation to dissipate when

everything else palled i

took up theology i made a bet

with another student that the soul

was not immortal the only way to

settle it was to die and find out we both

did well fellows we both lost mine

proved to be immortal for here i am but his

was not it completely disappeared and

has never been heard of again

which shows you never can tell and

yet i am still interested in

games of chance

archy





psychic


boss i have had a terrible time

since i last wrote you as i

told you long ago i was originally a

vers libre poet and my

soul after leaving that body

migrated into the

body of a cockroach before that

happened i did not believe in the

doctrine of transmigration of

souls but after it happened

how could i refuse to credit it well

it gave me a great deal of interest

in all psychic matters and it

struck me not many weeks ago that

if it were possible for a soul

to leave a poet that way and go into

the body of a cockroach

at the poets death it might be

possible to manage it without death the

truth is that i got tired of being a

cockroach and wanted to be

human again i practised and practised

until i found myself able to get out

of the cockroach body and

naked on the air of heaven ride but it

is not all that it is cracked up to be

there is nothing that can get so

cold as a soul these autumn nights

when it has no body and no blankets

and in winter it is worse yet after i

had gained proficiency i began

to look around for a human to

get into but as far as i could

learn every human was filled with

a soul already but i began to

make longer and longer trips away from

my cockroach body imagine my

consternation and surprise one day

some weeks ago upon returning to the

cockroach body which i had left to find

that it had been squashed and swept out

with a broom i looked at the fragments

with horror it was a very discouraged

looking set of remains but there i

was out in the world with

no shelter all sould up as you might

say and no place to go it may strike you

as nothing to worry about and it

wasnt so bad for a day or two but there

is a horrid sense of helplessness

about it if you are interested in

psychic research and that

sort of thing you can get a

little fun for a while appearing in

seances and balling up the messages

but believe me psychic research is more

interesting when you are the human calling

up the spirits than when you

are the ghost too often

they make you the goat that

soon palled on me and i wandered for

weeks the most lonely thing in new york

city at last in despair i

got into the carcase of another cockroach

again of about the same size and

general appearance of my old frame but

the whole affair has had a most

depressing effect on me imagine taking

all that trouble to get away from

being a cockroach and then get

shoved back into one by

fate again i think i will

stick to the old homestead for a

while how do i know but what the next

time i might get into the body of a

flea or a communist

archy





destiny


well boss here i

am a cockroach still boss

i have often been disgusted

with life but now i am

even more disgusted

with death and transmigration i

would rather not inhabit

any body at all than

inhabit a cockroachs

body but it seems i

cant escape it that

is my destiny my doom my

punishment

when you struck me that

terrific blow a few

days ago and i

died there at

your feet my first

sensation was one of glad

relief what body will

the soul of archy transmigrate

into now i asked

myself will i go

higher in the scale of

life and inhabit the

body of a butterfly

or a dog or a

bird or will i sink

lower and go into the

carcase of a poison

spider or a politician

i sat on a blade of

grass and waited and wondered

what it would be i

hoped it wouldnt be

anything at all too soon

because if you remember

it was a hot

day and as i sat

on that blade of grass

in my naked soul and

let my feet hang over i

was deliciously

cool try it some of

these hot nights leave

your body in the

bed and go up on the

roof in your

spirit and float around

like a toy balloon its

great stuff well while

i was sitting there

thinking what i

would inhabit next if

it was up to me

personally i had

a swooning sensation

and when i came

to i was in the

flesh again dad gum

it i lifted first

one leg and then

another to see what i

was this time and

imagine my chagrin and

disappointment when i

found myself inside

another cockroach the

exact counterpart of the

one you smashed whats

the use of dying if

it dont get you

anywhere i was so

sore i went and

murdered a tumblebug i

suppose as a cockroach

i was not good enough

to be promoted

and not bad enough to

be set back boss a

thing like that makes a

fellow feel awful humble i

came back to town in

that special delivery letter i

would rather dodge

the thing

they cancel stamps with

all day than walk again

say boss

please thank my friends

for all the kind

words and flowers i

must close in haste there

is a new rat

in your office since i

was here last i

wish you would sprinkle a

little cereal in the

bottom of the waste paper

basket

archy





a discussion


there is a good deal

of metaphysical discussion going on

amongst my own little group here

i said freddy the rat was no

more he expired at the moment he

slew that tarantula well he had

once been a human and had

transmigrated into a rat just

as i had transmigrated into a

cockroach the question now

is where will freddy turn up next will

he go up or down the scale and

that has led to the further question as

to what is up and what is down

producing considerable dissension all the

spiders claim they are higher in

the scale than the cockroaches and that

lazy cat mehitabel looks on superciliously

as if confident that she has it on

all of us spiritually speaking

well all i have to say is that in

my case a soul got out of a vers libre

bard into a cockroach but i have

known cases which are exactly the

reverse if you get what i mean

not that i would name any names

archy





quarantined


well boss i suppose you

wonder what has become of

me lately i have been

quarantined or rather

i quarantined myself

voluntarily lest

i help spread the

influenza on the

back of a cockroach

no larger than

myself millions of

influenza germs may lodge i

have a sense of responsibility

to the public and i

have been lying for two weeks

in a barrel of moth

balls in a drug store

without food or water it

strikes me as a good time to

come across with that

raise of salary you

are always promising me

archy





archy s statue


say boss but its great to

be famous when i saw that pedestrian

statue of myself on your desk i reflected that not

every one is privileged to see his

monument erected before he dies nor

after either for that matter it

gave me the feeling that i was looking at my own

tombstone erected in memory of my good

deeds how noble i will have to be to live up

to all that i felt just as a person might

feel who was hearing his own funeral

sermon preached over him i

stared at the statue and the statue stared at

me and i resolved in the future to be

a better cockroach of course it doesn’t flatter me

any my middle set of legs arent really

that bowed but the intellectual look

on my face is all there

archy





the open spaces


one trouble with

cockroaches is that they

do not get

out into the open

air enough

even the tumble

bugs play golf

and it keeps

them serene and

wholesome even the

angle worms feel

drawn to the

brook side in the

spring i am trying

to start a

back to nature movement

among my fellow

cockroaches maybe i

can count on the

co operation of the

housewives league i

am convinced that a

great deal of the

popular prejudice against

cockroaches would

vanish if they

took to the great

open spaces yours

archy





short course in natural history


you should be glad

you re not a tomcat

for when all is said

and done

you know youd hate

to pay insurance

on nine lives instead of one

be glad you re not

a centipede

you might your whole

ambition lose

if you had to find

the cash

to keep a centipede

in shoes

be glad you re not

a devilfish

if you had four pairs

of feet

what a trail

you d leave behind you

when you staggered

with the heat

archy





archy protests


well boss now youve got

your desk all cleaned up for the

first time since ive known you what

am i going to do for

a safe retreat in times of dire

need formerly i could crawl under a

bushel of poems and mehitabel the

cat could not find me this

room is as bare as the inside of

a drum you might at

least have left me a tobacco can i

feel as visible as a hyphen and not

half so sure of myself

archy





archy on amateur gardens


well boss i have

been looking over your

garden and my

thoughts on the

subject have fallen naturally

into the form of a little

dialogue among the

plants and inhabitants of the

garden to wit as follows



garter snake

how wan on the first of july

the gardens of april appear

now the plants that aspired to the sky

droop and think of the bier

first onion

i am a disillusioned onion plant

so sad so sad am i

that if one fed me to a maiden ant

she would curl up and die



indeterminate vegetable

in youth i hoped a bean to grow

but what i am i do not know



first beet

i have malaria croup and botts



second beet

i have such leprous looking spots



third beet

i was a beet of promise as a young beet

but now i have the mournful feeling

that neither root nor top nor peeling

will ever be fit to eat



garter snake

ah what a melancholy patch



toad

yon egg plant there will never hatch



indeterminate vegetable

one paused by me but yesterday

and spoke of me as hay

but what i really am i do not know



cucumber vine

strange insects walk me to and fro



pepper plant

had i been treated with formaldehyde

that goat that in the dewy eves

came here to feast upon my leaves

might not have died



second onion

the great splay feet of destiny

have trodden me have trampled me



rhubarb

ah once i hoped to line a pie



cucumber vine

will you marauding hen pass by

or must i die



indeterminate vegetable

what thing i am i do not know

men have no name for me



garter snake

i think you are a spinach vine



toad

and i should call you eglantine



sparrow

perhaps you are a pea



first bean

i was a bean

unto some glad tureen

i might have given tone

but a dog yestereen

hiding a bone

took from me all my mundane hope



indeterminate vegetable

sometimes i think i am a canteloupe



second bean

drooping between two hills of corn

i am the butt of all mens scorn



third bean

ah how i aspired

in the glad may morn



fourth bean

i am so tired so tired



sparrow

friend toad from yonder plant keep you away

i saw a neighbor child but yesterday

from off its foliage pluck a spray

and then how he yelled

and his hand turned black and swelled



indeterminate vegetable

perhaps im not a plant at all

but some strange sort of animal



first cabbage

pigeons have riddled me and weasels



second cabbage

im spotted as with german measles



first corn stalk

woe



second corn stalk

woe



third corn stalk

woe is me ah woe woe woe



fourth corn stalk

even the weeds beside me do not grow



first turnip

gott



second turnip

gott gott gott



third turnip

mildew blight and rot



fourth turnip

and smallpox like as not



indeterminate vegetable

but cheer brothers cheer

perhaps before the year

dwindles to winter drear

well poison some one here

i know not what i am

parsley from siam

a vegetable ham

or a long island clam

but this i know i hate

my miserable state

and all human beans

i hate life and fate

i hate men and greens

i hate hens and grass

i hate garden sass

who gets me on a plate

shall learn how i hate

i hate chards romaine

children and goats

old men and young men

people and oats

and im full of ptomaine

who puts me within him

scorpions had better skin him

who puts me inside her

had better eat a spider

i know not what i be

alfalfa corn or pea

but cheer brothers cheer

before the glad new year

well poison some one here



i might give you some advice

about your garden

boss but likely you would

not thank me for it

so i will only make one

suggestion to wit if the

garden were mine i

would set out another cabbage

plant in it and then

give it to the butterflies for

an aviation ground

archy





i would rather far get pally with a pretzel and a seidel





archy on this and that



1


an old stomach

reforms more whiskey drinkers

than a new resolve

and the sexton

stops more than either





2


the world would take its ethics

as seriously as its amusements



three em dash

if they were as amusing





3


a man who is so dull

that he can learn only by personal experience

is too dull to learn

anything important by experience





4


a great many people

who spend their time mourning

over the brevity of life

could make it seem longer

if they did a little more work





5


judging by the number and variety

of pills and religions in the world

the chief preoccupation of man

has been the state of his digestion

and the condition of his soul

and just look at both of them





6


a lot of people

would get back to work now

but they cant afford to take the time off

from keeping the relief agencies going

for if they shut up

that would throw a lot of specialists

out of jobs

i heard one of these bozos

talking to a buddy the other day and made

a little song out of his sentiments

as follows

the dignity of labor

is a phrase i like to see

imposing on my neighbor

but it cant impose on me

i had rather dilly dally

rest and loaf and idle

i would rather far get pally

with a pretzel and a seidel

of beer





mehitabel sees it through


dear boss i met mehitabel

last night and asked her if

she did not think times were getting

a little better

she was digging for sustenance in a trash heap

at the moment and she looked as if

she might be a part of the heap herself

one of her legs has been damaged again

in a fight with a rival in love

but she began to caper when i spoke to her

and replied as follows



good times and bad times

recoveries and depressions

wotthehell do i care

as long as somethings doing

when i lived on salmon

and oysters stewed in cream

i wasnt always happy

when i dug my scoffins

out of frozen garbage heaps

i wasnt always sad

economic problems

never tell the story

as far as im concerned

once i lived a fortnight

on moonlight wind and grass

and i danced every evening

with the shadows in the alley

and entertained my boy friends

with my melodious songs

wotthehell do i care

if the stomachs empty

when the spirits full

i have had my ups





boss i think mehitabel is mistaken about the milky way

and i have had my downs

but whether i was up

or whether i was down

there was something in my blood

that always set it dancing

and when the blood was jigging

the feet began to caper

some day i will voyage

on top a garbage scow

just a stiff dead feline

wreathed in orange peel and melon rinds

with shop worn salad garnished

down the bay theyll take me

to the dumping grounds

defunct as ancient nut shells

but wotchehell do i care

that day has not arrived

and good times or bad times

hard times or easy

there are three good feet

on old mehitabel

and she will keep them jigging

till the grim reaper slices

two more of them off

and then she ll dance on one

till its frozen and resigns

and then her soul will caper

along the milky way

theres a dance or two in the old dame yet

and the word is toujours gai

boss i think mehitabel is mistaken

about the milky way

i think she is more like to dance

on hot cinders in the hereafter

archy





mehitabel meets her mate


tis the right of a modern tabby to choose

the cats who shall father her kits

and its nice to be sure their pasts have been pure

and theyre free from fleas or fits



trial marriage i tried till i thoroughly tired

and i suffered somewhat from abduction

and my heart it was broken again and again

but twas excellent instruction



i always have been rather awesomely blest

with the instincts of a mother

and my life and my fate have been down to date

one kitten after another



triplets quadruplets quintuplets

in a most confusing succession

and it seems to keep up whether times are good

or wallowing in depression



and this is in spite of the terrible fact

i am not a real home body

but an artiste who views the domestic career

as damnably dull and shoddy



for i am a lady who has her whims

no torn cat holds my love

if i come to feel i have plighted my troth

to a little mauve turtle dove



but at last i have found my real romance

through the process of trial and error

and he is a ribald brute named bill

one eyed and a holy terror



his skull is ditched from a hundred fights

and he has little hair on his tail

but the son of a gun of a brindled hun

is indubitably male



over the fences we frolic and prance

under the blood red moon

and sing to the stars we are venus and mars

as we caper and clutch and croon



his good eye gleams like a coal of hell

from the murk of alley or yard

and the heart that jumps in the cage of his ribs

is hot and black and hard



says he as we rocket over the roofs

can you follow your limber bill

says i to him my demon slim

theres a dance in the old dame still



you pussies that purr on a persian rug

or mew to some fool for cream

little you know of the wild delight

of the outlaws midnight dream



a fish head filched from a garbage can

or a milk bottle raided at dawn

is better than safety and slavery

you punks that cuddle and fawn



you can stuff your bellies with oysters and shrimp

you may have your ribbon and bell

for bill and me it is liberty

o wotthehell bill wotthehell



says he to me old battle axe

you never was raised a pet

says i to willie i aint any lily

but theres pep in the old dame yet



last night when a bull pup gave us chase

bill turned and a rip of his claw

completely unseamed that slavering mutt

from his chin to his bloody jaw



we dance with the breeze of the summer nights

we dance with the winter sleet

with velvet paws on the velvet shadows

or whirl with frozen feet



we riot over the roof of the world

mehitabel and bill

you son of a gun of a brindled hun

theres a dance in the old dame still





she flung a party in shinbone alley





mehitabel pulls a party


dear boss mehitabel shows

no evidences of reform

she flung a party in shinbone alley

last night and six of the toughest

tabbies i ever saw were her guests

all seven of them danced on the ash cans

flirting their tails in the moonlight

and chanting as follows



oh wotthell do we care

theres a dance or two in the old janes yet

so caper and swing about

meow meow meow

archy





was not a ship at all it was a dive in harlem





mehitabel joins the navy


expenses going up

and income going down

but wotthehell do i care

the sailors are in town



a tom cat off a cruiser

was seeing of the city

says he between his whiskers

hello my pretty kitty



oh i am pure and careful

in manner well instructed

i ve seldom spoke to strangers

and seldom been abducted



so i replied discreetly

aint you the nervy guy

how dare you brace a lady

so innocent and shy



oh look he said our warships

have all their flags unfurled

oh come and join the navy

and we will see the world



but the first place that he took me

was not a ship at all

it was a dive in harlem

where they hailed him admiral



a loud shebeen in harlem

which flowed with song and cheer

and we danced upon the tables

for oysters stewed in beer



the second place he took me

he had been there before

we danced for smelt and fishballs

and they called him commodore



twas down in coney island

they named me puss cafe

as we danced among the bottles

for cream and gin frappe



my room rent keeps a mounting

and credit going down

but wotthehell do i care

the sailors are in town



the next place that we landed

he done a noble deed

he sliced the eye from a fresh wharf cat

who tried to make my speed



avast you swabs and lubbers

when a sailor says ahoy

tis a patriotic duty

to give the navy joy



oh i always am the lady

discreet as well as gay

but the next place that he took me

the devil was to pay



for we seen the icebox open

and tried to raid the loot

and the next we knew we was out in the street

ahead of the barkeep s boot



but wotthehell do i care

i neither whine nor fret

what though my spine is out of line

there s a dance in the old dame yet



i would not desert the navy

nor leave it in the lurch

though each place that he took me

was less and less like a church



and now the fleet is sailing

with all its flags unfurled

and five little kittens with anchor marks

are tagging me round through the alleys and parks

but i have seen the world



oh my maternal instinct

has proved to be my curse

it started when i was an ingenue

and went from bad to worse



but wotthehell do i care

whether its tom or bill

for any sailor off of the fleet

there s a dance in the old dame still

mehitabel the cat





what is a lady


mehitabel has

asseverated that

she is a lady

now to decide a bet

will you please

let her tell us

what constitutes

a lady



she must be

an authority on

the subject or else

you would not

print an account

of her doings which seem

to some of us girls

inconsistent with the

standards of

highly respectable conduct

that prevail in this

midvictorian village of

westport conn

i don t know

how it ever got

a name like that

for there ain t anything

sporty about it except it s name

and only half of that

but us girls

want to be ladies and

live up to our

village ideals in

that respect

so please let

mehitabel tell us

what constitutes a lady

and is it

possible for a lady

to be a cat



give my love

to darling archy

yours truly

lady bug



p s

do real ladies

smoke pipes

or drink cocktails

or other alcoholic

beverages

or go joy riding

or have

petting parties

or wear onepiece

bathing costumes

where anybody

can see them

or do they instead

knock their

friends and

neighbors every

chance they get

and take a great

interest in civic

affairs and local

politics and

go around

doing good

and being

gracious to

their inferiors



The answer is yes and no.





he is not true to me what shall i do





archy denies it


dear sir i view with alarm

and it breaks my heart to see it

that archy is associating

with that hussy mehitabel

you must know that he

is my affinity

and my affianced lover

and now he has been going

around with

that disreputable old cat

and he

is not true

to me

what shall i do

i ask you

i am a nice girl

i live in a lovely rosebush

and when we got married

i thought archy would

live at home with me and mama

i am afraid now i will have to break

my engagement

as well as my heart

and i will burn up my

wedding dress which is

beautiful red with polka dots

my life is wrecked

my happiness blighted

o how could he be so false

lady bug



When this serious charge was called to the attention of Archy he hopped over to the typewriter and bumped out the following reply:

this is the sort of thing

that happens to people

who get their

names in the papers

that is all

the comment i care

to make

archy





a farewell


archy

i cant believe

you are the hen hater

you profess

you are too handsome

i saw you

the day you walked down

fifth avenue

heading the roach delegation

you were magnificent

as the sun s rays

glinted off

your bronzed back

and your speech was beautiful

about adequate housing

conditions

and better treatment

for stranger cockroaches

within thy gates

but never mind

i will write no more

yet whenever i hear

your name mentioned

i shall be seized in the grasp

of a great grief

thinking what might have been

if you had only known

how really charming

i am

i have letters

from my first two husbands

to prove it

which i have always

kept

farewell

Archy, touched to the quick by the above epistle—and so ignorant of feminine wiles that he does not know the females of all species are most dangerous when they appear to retreat—dictated the following reply:

poor thing i wonder

if it would not be

a kindness to

walk by her house

and let her just

look at me

once more

poor thing

archy





archy still in trouble


archy

believe me

i don t quite

know how to thank you

for your generous emotion

over my unfortunate regard

but i beg of you

not to permit this melancholy

to disturb you unduly

i shall be strong

and shall throw myself

into my work

inspired by the thoughts

of my happy children

for i am a good mother

not like

mehitabel

jennie



p s on Wednesdays at four

we have tea and nice cakes

at our house

should you care to come

i can promise you

food

that can be trusted

how welcome

you would be

my ancestors

came over on the may flower



To which Archy dictated the following reply:

say doesnt

she know when

she has been ignored

archy





the feline tribe were worshipped in ancient egypt





not any proof


mehitabel the cat

tells me the feline

tribe were worshipped

in ancient egypt

and for that reason i

should hold her in more

respect

well says i

minerva burst from

the head of jove

with a heluva yell

but that does not prove

that we should

stand in awe

of every case of

mastoiditis

archy





go to the country and become grasshoppers





statesmanship


i was talking

with an insect the

other day about the

hard times that

cockroaches have to

get a living every

mans hand is against them

and occasionally his

foot meals

are few and far between

why in the world

says this

insect do you not

go to the country and become

grasshoppers if

living in town and being

cockroaches is getting

too difficult for you

i was astonished

at the simplicity of the

solution but as i

thought it over it occurred

to me that

perhaps it sounded more

statesmanlike than it

really was

how i asked him are

cockroaches to become

grasshoppers

that is a mere

detail he said which i

leave to you for

solution i have outlined

the general scheme for your

salvation so do not ask

me to settle the mere

details i trust to you for

that you must do

something for yourself

we philosophers cannot do it all

for you unaided you

must learn self help

but alas i fear that

your inherent stupidity will

balk all efforts

to improve your condition

boss i offer you

this little story

for what it is worth

if you are able to

find in it something

analogous to a number

of easy schemes

for the improvement of the

human race you

may do immense good by

printing it

yours for reform

spring


i get about

a good deal

among the insects

especially when

spring arrives

and yesterday

i heard an

argument between

an early cricket

and a busy bee

the cricket spoke

in part as follows



the harps of spring

are in the air

the blackbird

sings

i do not care

a damn if school

keeps in

or not

the jonquil says

all work is rot

the pollywog

has hours to spare



let us rejoice

and from us tear

in glee

our winter

underwear

and let us

dance

and let us

swat

the harps of spring



considering

the lilies there

how do the wicked

ploughmen dare

to lard

their fields with sweav

and plot

increase of gear

by toil begot

we scorn them

we that dance

and bear

the harps of spring

to which the

little busy bee

retorted hummingly

you bards and birds

make such a din

when april s

heedless days begin

flouting

all honest industry

all providence

and husbandry

from every

flower thatched

wayside inn



though heaven

may forgive your sin

of mockery

yet none may win

earth s pardon

for such levity

you bards

and birds

when winter s

sleets

pierce plume and skin

then comes

the ploughman s turn

to grin

by hearth logs

blazing merrily

and feasting burghers

laugh to see

such piping tune fools

cold and thin

you bards and birds

the argument

is one that

does not touch me

personally

no matter what

the season

i can always find

a ragout

where i may drop in

for a warm bath

and a bite to eat

archy the cockroach





the author s desk


i climbed upon my boss his desk

to type a flaming ballad

and there i found a heap grotesque

of socks and songs and salad



some swedenborgian dope on hell

with modernistic hunches

remnants of plays that would not jell

and old forgotten lunches



a plate once flushed with pride and pie

now chill with pallid verses

a corkless jug of ink hard by

sobbed out its life with curses



six sad bedraggled things lay there

inertly as dead cats

three sexless rhymes that could not pair

and three discouraged spats



the feet of song be tender things

like to the feet of waiters

and need when winter bites and stings

sesquipedalian gaiters



peter the pup sprawled on the heap

disputing all approaches

or growled and grumbled in his sleep

or waked and snapped at roaches



i found a treatise on the soul

which bragged it undefeated

and a bill for thirteen tons of coal

by fate left unreceipted



books on the modern girl s advance

wrapped in a cutey sark

with honi soit qui mal y pense

worked for its laundry mark



mid broken glass the spider slinks

while memories stir and glow

of olden happy far off drinks

and bottles long ago



such is the litter at the root

of song and story rising

or noisome pipe or cast off boot

feeding and fertilizing



as lilies burgeon from the dirt

into the golden day

dud epic and lost undershirt

survive times slow decay



still burrowing far and deep i found

a razor coldly soapy

and at the center of the mound

some most surprising opi



some modest pages chaste and shy

for pocket poke or sporran

written by archy published by

doubleday and doran

archy the cockroach





what the ants are saying


dear boss i was talking with an ant

the other day

and he handed me a lot of

gossip which ants the world around

are chewing over among themselves



i pass it on to you

in the hope that you may relay it to other

human beings and hurt their feelings with it

no insect likes human beings

and if you think you can see why

the only reason i tolerate you is because

you seem less human to me than most of them

here is what the ants are saying



it wont be long now it wont be long

man is making deserts of the earth

it wont be long now

before man will have used it up

so that nothing but ants

and centipedes and scorpions

can find a living on it

man has oppressed us for a million years

but he goes on steadily

cutting the ground from under

his own feet making deserts deserts deserts



we ants remember

and have it all recorded

in our tribal lore

when gobi was a paradise

swarming with men and rich

in human prosperity

it is a desert now and the home

of scorpions ants and centipedes



what man calls civilization

always results in deserts

man is never on the square

he uses up the fat and greenery of the earth

each generation wastes a little more

of the future with greed and lust for riches



north africa was once a garden spot

and then came carthage and rome

and despoiled the storehouse

and now you have sahara

sahara ants and centipedes



toltecs and aztecs had a mighty

civilization on this continent

but they robbed the soil and wasted nature

and now you have deserts scorpions ants and centipedes

and the deserts of the near east

followed egypt and babylon and assyria

and persia and rome and the turk

the ant is the inheritor of tamerlane

and the scorpion succeeds the caesars



america was once a paradise

of timberland and stream

but it is dying because of the greed

and money lust of a thousand little kings

who slashed the timber all to hell

and would not be controlled

and changed the climate

and stole the rainfall from posterity

and it wont be long now

it wont be long

till everything is desert

from the alleghenies to the rockies

the deserts are coming

the deserts are spreading

the springs and streams are drying up

one day the mississippi itself

will be a bed of sand

ants and scorpions and centipedes

shall inherit the earth



men talk of money and industry

of hard times and recoveries

of finance and economics

but the ants wait and the scorpions wait

for while men talk they are making deserts all the time

getting the world ready for the conquering ant

drought and erosion and desert

because men cannot learn



rainfall passing off in flood and freshet

and carrying good soil with it

because there are no longer forests

to withhold the water in

the billion meticulations of the roots



it wont be long now it won’t be long

till earth is barren as the moon

and sapless as a mumbled bone



dear boss i relay this information

without any fear that humanity

will take warning and reform

archy
