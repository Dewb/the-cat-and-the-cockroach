nature hides
the most beautiful
 
design : the norm,
the anomaly ,
 
the rare , the rarest ,
which is to say ,
 
the only , and aren â€™ t we
each , twins even , only ? 


expression is the need of my soul
i was once a vers libre bard
but i died and my soul went
into the body of a cockroach
it has given me a new outlook on life

i see things from the under side now

i had a serious talk
with our friend mehitabel recently
and i am very much afraid boss
that she will never reform
domesticity never
appealed to me archy
she told me
i know a lot of tame tabbies
and what do they get
out of life
nothing my dear
but respectability
and a sense of superiority
life for them is just
one damned kitten after another
and they have no medium
for self expression
but me exclamation point
i am free as the air
i live for art
it is better to be found frozen
in an alley and go down the by
in a garbage scow
than to be afraid
to kick your heels up on the floor
for fear of what the tabby
next door will think
do not pity my way of life
i live as the gods ordained i should
i am never so happy
as when i am broke
and lately i have been happy all the time
expression expression
my life is all expression
does the warm fireside
and a silken rug
and cream and oysters
at regular hours never appeal
to you mehitabel i ask her
i have had all those things archy
she said and i left them
for the lure of adventure
romance or nothing is my motto
today i am up tomorrow i am down
but i am always gay
and always the lady
do you never have any qualms of conscience
with regard to your unconventionalities
i asked her
what i am i am exclamation point
she said
and if there were more 
like me in the world
heaven forbid i said interrupting her
the secret of life
as i have always found it she said
is always to shoot the whole roll
never go in for half measures
in anything
this principle has no doubt led
to your success in life i said
with veiled irony
yes she said quite complacently
as she struggled with an ancient fish bone
i owe all that i am to these
principles
boss what are you going to do 
with these spirits
who are miserable
and do not know it
who are iniquitous and proud of it
who are pitiable
and boast of their condition
who are defeated
and believe themselves victorious
who are corrupt
and contented
who are undeserving
and talk of their principles
who are unconscious that they should repent
who are disreputable
and gay
it is a problem i pass along
to the sociologists
