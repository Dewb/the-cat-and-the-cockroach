nature hides
the most beautiful
 
design : the norm,
the anomaly ,
 
the rare , the rarest ,
which is to say ,
 
the only , and aren â€™ t we
each , twins even , only ? 


expression is the need of my soul
i was once a vers libre bard
but i died and my soul went
into the body of a cockroach
it has given me a new outlook on life

i see things from the under side now
