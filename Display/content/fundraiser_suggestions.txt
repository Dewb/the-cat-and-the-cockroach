I really did meet a blind girl in Paris once. 
It was in the garden of a museum, 
Where I saw her touching the statues. 
She had brown hair and an aquamarine scarf.

It was in the garden of the museum. 
I told her I was a thief disguised as a guard. 
She had brown hair and an aquamarine scarf. 
She told me she was a student from Grenoble.

I told her I was not a thief disguised as a guard. 
We had coffee at the little commissary. 
She said she had time till her train to Grenoble. 
We talked about our supreme belief in art.

Then sat on a bench near the foundry. 
We talked about our supreme belief in art. 
She leaned her head upon my chest.

We kissed on a bench near the foundry. 
I closed my eyes when no one was watching.

The museum was closing. It was time to part.

I really did meet a blind girl in Paris once. 
I never saw her again and she never saw me. 
In a garden she touched the statues. 
She put on her lipstick in the dark.

I close my eyes when no one is watching. 
She had brown hair and an aquamarine scarf. 
The museum was closing. It was time to part. 
I never saw her again and she never saw me.

 If I loved you any more
my heart would be
a bus on time in bad weather 
and late when you are late
my heart would be an elevator 
as fast as your haste
and car keys always in the first place you look

If I loved you any more
my heart would be

-----------------

mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my 
breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that 
was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him 
because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I 
gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer 
first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of 
Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all 
birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of 
the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish 
girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and 
the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street 
and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep 
and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts 
of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white 
and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old 
windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops 
half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman 
going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson 
sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the 
queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine 
and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I 
put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me 
under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my 
eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I 
put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes 
and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.

Mehitabel dances with Boreas

well boss i saw mehitabel
last evening
she was out in the alley
dancing on the cold cobbles
while the wild december wind
blew through her frozen whiskers
and as she danced
she wailed and sang to herself
uttering the fragments
that rattled in her cold brain
in part as follows

whirl mehitabel whirl
spin mehitabel spin
thank god you re a lady still
if you have got frozen skin

blow wind out of the north
to hell with being a pet
my left front foot is brittle
but there’s life in the old dame yet

dance mehitable dance
caper and shake a leg
what little blood is left
will fizz like wine in a keg

wind come out of the north
and pierce to the guts within
but some day mehitabel’s guts
will string a violin

moon you re as cold as a frozen
skin of a yellow banan
that sticks in the frost and ice
on top of a garbage can

and you throw a shadow so chilly
that it can scarcely leap
dance shadow dance
you ve got no place to sleep…

eight of my lives are gone
it s years since my fur was slicked
but blow north wind blow
i m damned if i am licked

girls we was all of us ladies
we was o what the hell
and once a lady always game
by crikey blood will tell

i might be somebody s pet
asleep by the fire on a rug
but me i was always romantic
i had the adventurous bug

caper mehitabel caper
leap shadow leap
you gotto dance till the sun comes up
for you got no place to sleep

i might have been many a tom cat s wife
but i got no regret
i lived my life as i liked my life
there s pep in the old dame yet…

dance mehitabel dance
till your old bones fly apart
i ain t got any regrets
for i gave my life to my art

whirl mehitabel whirl
caper my girl and grin
and pick at your guts with your frosty feet
they re the strings of a violin

girls we was all of us ladies
until we went and fell
and oncet a thoroughbred always game
i ask you whotthehell…

A favorite bit from David Foster Wallace's "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"

‘It’s cost me every sexual relationship I ever had. I don’t know why I do it. I’m not a
political person, I don’t considermyself. I’m not one of these America First, read the newspaper,
will Buchanan get the nod people. I’ll be doing it with somegirl, it doesn’t matter who. It’s when I
start to come. That it happens. I’m not a Democrat. I don’t even vote. I freakedout about it one time
and called a radio show about it, a doctor on the radio, anonymously, and he diagnosed it as the
uncontrolledyelling of involuntary words or phrases, frequently insulting or scatological, which is
coprolalia is the official term. Exceptwhen I start to come and always start yelling it it’s not
insulting, it’s not obscene, it’s always the same thing, and it’salways so weird but I don’t think
insulting. I think it’s just weird. And uncontrolled. It’s like it comes out the same waythe spooge
comes out, it feels like that. I don’t know what it’s about and I can’t help it.’
Q.
‘“Victory for the Forces of Democratic Freedom!” Only way louder. As in really shouting it.
Uncontrollably. I’m not even thinkingit until it comes out and I hear it. “Victory for the Forces of
Democratic Freedom!” Only louder than that: “VICTORY—”’
Q.
‘Well it totally freaks them out, what do you think? And I just about die of the
embarrassment. I don’t ever know what tosay. What do you say if you just shouted “Victory for the
Forces of Democratic Freedom!” right when you came?’
Q.
‘It wouldn’t be so embarrassing if it wasn’t so totally fucking weird. If I had any clue about
what it was about. You know?’
Q….
‘God, now I’m embarrassed as hell.’
Q.
‘But all there is is the once. That’s what I mean about it costing. I can tell how bad it freaks
them out, and I get embarrassed and nevercall them again. Even if I try to explain. And it’s the ones
that’ll act all understanding like they don’t care and it’s OKand they understand and it doesn’t
matter that embarrass me the worst, because it’s so fucking weird to yell “Victory forthe Forces of
Democratic Freedom!” when you’re shooting off that I can always tell they’re totally freaked out
and just condescendingdown to me and pretending they understand, and those are the ones where
actually I actually end up almost getting pissed offand don’t even feel embarrassed not calling them
or totally avoiding them, the ones that say “I think I could love you anyway.”’

there's a bluebird in my heart that
wants to get out
but I'm too tough for him,
I say, stay in there, I'm not going
to let anybody see
you.
there's a bluebird in my heart that
wants to get out
but I pour whiskey on him and inhale
cigarette smoke
and the whores and the bartenders
and the grocery clerks
never know that
he's
in there.

there's a bluebird in my heart that
wants to get out
but I'm too tough for him,
I say,
stay down, do you want to mess
me up? 
you want to screw up the
works? 
you want to blow my book sales in
Europe? 
there's a bluebird in my heart that
wants to get out
but I'm too clever, I only let him out
at night sometimes
when everybody's asleep.
I say, I know that you're there,
so don't be
sad.
then I put him back,
but he's singing a little
in there, I haven't quite let him
die
and we sleep together like
that
with our
secret pact
and it's nice enough to
make a man
weep, but I don't
weep, do
you? 
Charles Bukowski

I lie on my back at midnight
hearing the marvelous strange chime
of the clocks, and know it's mid-
night and in that instant the whole
world swims into sight for me
in the form of beautiful swarm-
ing m u t t a worlds-
everything is happening, shining
Buhudda-lands, 
bhuti

blazing in faith, I know I'm
forever right & all's I got to
do (as I hear the ordinary
extant voices of ladies talking
in some kitchen at midnight
oilcloth cups of cocoa
cardore to mump the
rinnegain in his
darlin drain-) i will write
it, all the talk of the world
everywhere in this morning, leav-
ing open parentheses sections
for my own accompanying inner
thoughts-with roars of me
all brain-all world
roaring-vibrating-I put
it down, swiftly, 1,000 words
(of pages) compressed into one second
of time-I'll be long
robed & long gold haired in
the famous Greek afternoon
of some Greek City
Fame Immortal & they'll
have to find me where they find
the t h n u p f t of my
shroud bags flying
flag yagging Lucien
Midnight back in their
mouths-Gore Vidal'll
be amazed, annoyed-
my words'll be writ in gold
& preserved in libraries like
Finnegans Wake & Visions of Neal 
Jack Kerouac

-------------------------------------------
 if it doesn’t come bursting out of you
in spite of everything,
don’t do it.
unless it comes unasked out of your
heart and your mind and your mouth
and your gut,
don’t do it.
if you have to sit for hours
staring at your computer screen
or hunched over your
typewriter
searching for words,
don’t do it.
if you’re doing it for money or
fame,
don’t do it.
if you’re doing it because you want
women in your bed,
don’t do it.
if you have to sit there and
rewrite it again and again,
don’t do it.
if it’s hard work just thinking about doing it,
don’t do it.
if you’re trying to write like somebody
else,
forget about it.

if you have to wait for it to roar out of
you,
then wait patiently.
if it never does roar out of you,
do something else.

if you first have to read it to your wife
or your girlfriend or your boyfriend
or your parents or to anybody at all,
you’re not ready.

don’t be like so many writers,
don’t be like so many thousands of
people who call themselves writers,
don’t be dull and boring and
pretentious, don’t be consumed with self-
love.
the libraries of the world have
yawned themselves to
sleep
over your kind.
don’t add to that.
don’t do it.
unless it comes out of
your soul like a rocket,
unless being still would
drive you to madness or
suicide or murder,
don’t do it.
unless the sun inside you is
burning your gut,
don’t do it.

when it is truly time,
and if you have been chosen,
it will do it by
itself and it will keep on doing it
until you die or it dies in you.

there is no other way.

and there never was.

-so you want to be a writer?, Charles Bukowski

--------------------------------------

Yes, Atthis, you may be sure

Even in Sardis
Anactoria will think often of us

of the life we shared here, when you seemed
the Goddess incarnate
to her and your singing pleased her best

Now among Lydian women she in her
turn stands first as the red-
fingered moon rising at sunset takes

precedence over stars around her;
her light spreads equally
on the salt sea and fields thick with bloom

Delicious dew pours down to freshen
roses, delicate thyme
and blossoming sweet clover; she wanders

aimlessly, thinking of gentle
Atthis, her heart hanging
heavy with longing in her little breast

She shouts aloud, Come! we know it;
thousand-eared night repeats that cry
across the sea shining between us

Sappho
tr. Barnard

The Shrinking Lonesome Sestina
 Somewhere in everyone's head something points toward home,
 a dashboard's floating compass, turning all the time
 to keep from turning. It doesn't matter how we come
 to be wherever we are, someplace where nothing goes
 the way it went once, where nothing holds fast
 to where it belongs, or what you've risen or fallen to.

 What the bubble always points to,
 whether we notice it or not, is home.
 It may be true that if you move fast
 everything fades away, that given time
 and noise enough, every memory goes
 into the blackness, and if new ones come-

 small, mole-like memories that come
 to live in the furry dark-they, too,
 curl up and die. But Carol goes
 to high school now. John works at home
 what days he can to spend some time
 with Sue and the kids. He drives too fast.

 Ellen won't eat her breakfast.
 Your sister was going to come
 but didn't have the time.
 Some mornings at one or two
 or three I want you home
 a lot, but then it goes.

 It all goes.
 Hold on fast
 to thoughts of home
 when they come.
 They're going to
 less with time.

 Time
 goes
 too
 fast.
 Come
 home.

 Forgive me that. One time it wasn't fast.
 A myth goes that when the years come
 then you will, too. Me, I'll still be home.
-- Miller Williams

You Will Know Her Disappearance
Janaka Stucky

You will know her disappearance
By the knife left upon your pillow’s case

A corpse with its hand
Stuck in a beehive

Glacier of blood

You will count the nights apart
On your remaining fingers

In the wet cave of your loneliness
You will spoon the knife against your naked frame

You will dream of the knife standing
At the window like she used to

And the knife will become her in a phosphorescent dress
And she will become the moon in the black sky
And the moon will leave you
 --------------------

How sad it is to drop a pickle,
watching its life flash before your eyes
as it tumbles down in slow-motion,
stopping abruptly as it hits the uncaring ground.

"It's just a pickle," you say.

True.

But you

Are just

a man.

-----------------------------
LET us go then, you and I, 
When the evening is spread out against the sky 
Like a patient etherized upon a table; 
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, 
The muttering retreats 
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels 
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: 
Streets that follow like a tedious argument 
Of insidious intent 
To lead you to an overwhelming question…. 
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?” 
Let us go and make our visit. 

In the room the women come and go 
Talking of Michelangelo. 

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, 
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes 
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, 
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, 
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, 
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, 
And seeing that it was a soft October night, 
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. 

And indeed there will be time 
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street, 
Rubbing its back upon the window panes; 
There will be time, there will be time 
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; 
There will be time to murder and create, 
And time for all the works and days of hands 
That lift and drop a question on your plate; 
Time for you and time for me, 
And time yet for a hundred indecisions, 
And for a hundred visions and revisions, 
Before the taking of a toast and tea. 

In the room the women come and go 
Talking of Michelangelo. 

And indeed there will be time 
To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?” 
Time to turn back and descend the stair, 
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair— 
(They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”) 
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, 
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin— 
(They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”) 
Do I dare 
Disturb the universe? 
In a minute there is time 
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. 

For I have known them all already, known them all: 
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons, 
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons; 
I know the voices dying with a dying fall 
Beneath the music from a farther room. 
So how should I presume? 

And I have known the eyes already, known them all— 
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase, 
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin, 
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall, 
Then how should I begin 
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways? 
And how should I presume? 

And I have known the arms already, known them all— 
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare 
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!) 
Is it perfume from a dress 
That makes me so digress? 
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl. 
And should I then presume? 
And how should I begin?
. . . . . . . .

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets 
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes 
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?… 

I should have been a pair of ragged claws 
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
. . . . . . . .

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully! 
Smoothed by long fingers, 
Asleep … tired … or it malingers, 
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me. 
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices, 
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis? 
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed, 
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter, 
I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter; 
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, 
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker, 
And in short, I was afraid. 

And would it have been worth it, after all, 
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, 
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, 
Would it have been worth while, 
To have bitten off the matter with a smile, 
To have squeezed the universe into a ball 
To roll it toward some overwhelming question, 
To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead, 
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”— 
If one, settling a pillow by her head, 
Should say: “That is not what I meant at all; 
That is not it, at all.” 

And would it have been worth it, after all, 
Would it have been worth while, 
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets, 
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor— 
And this, and so much more?— 
It is impossible to say just what I mean! 
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen: 
Would it have been worth while 
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, 
And turning toward the window, should say: 
“That is not it at all, 
That is not what I meant, at all.”
. . . . . . . .

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be; 
Am an attendant lord, one that will do 
To swell a progress, start a scene or two, 
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool, 
Deferential, glad to be of use, 
Politic, cautious, and meticulous; 
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse; 
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous— 
Almost, at times, the Fool. 

I grow old … I grow old … 
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. 

Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? 
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. 
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. 

I do not think that they will sing to me. 

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves 
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back 
When the wind blows the water white and black. 

We have lingered in the chambers of the sea 
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown 
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.
-The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, T.S.Eliot
----------------------------------------------

Lovers, forget your love,
And list to the love of these,
She a window flower,
And he a winter breeze.

When the frosty window veil
Was melted down at noon,
And the caged yellow bird
Hung over her in tune,

He marked her through the pane,
He could not help but mark,
And only passed her by
To come again at dark.

He was a winter wind,
Concerned with ice and snow,
Dead weeds and unmated birds,
And little of love could know.

But he sighed upon the sill,
He gave the sash a shake,
As witness all within
Who lay that night awake.

Perchance he half prevailed
To win her for the flight
From the firelit looking-glass
And warm stove-window light.

But the flower leaned aside
And thought of naught to say,
And morning found the breeze
A hundred miles away.

-Robert Frost

name the hole in your bed after yourself
know every way to unhinge, mask, swallow, deadbolt,
bridge, burn, bridge, burn, bridge, burn

let the word “why” swell in your mouth
until it evicts your tongue, your bite,
spit it onto the chest of your lover

do everything softly enough to be an apology
or a burial
do not dig yourself out

allow him to trample you when he calls himself forgiveness
forget that you do not need to be forgiven for anything

be what rots the fastest
sleep naked with the door unlocked
in the deep end of a sorrow you know now as
everything

say, “it’s okay”
when you mean, “i’ve been swimming for so long
that i do not know the concept of shore”

love your hands best when they’re empty,
the flowers most when they’re wilted

pretend you have survived everything
even though you have survived nothing,
left a corpse in every room

give birth to silences, name them
Erode or God or I’m Still Out Here Looking For You

want for a man to leave his teeth in your lungs,
to make your skin his skin,

crave that everything be served to you violently,
each day punched into your chest

crash the car
will the pavement to dance itself out of your throat

let only the men who don’t ask questions touch you
some things are impossible to say
you know this better than anything

T.S. Eliot (1888
T.S. Eliot (1888–1965).  The Waste Land.  1922. 

The Waste Land 




I. THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD

APRIL is the cruellest month, breeding
 
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
 
Memory and desire, stirring
 
Dull roots with spring rain.
 
Winter kept us warm, covering
         5
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
 
A little life with dried tubers.
 
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
 
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
 
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
  10
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
 
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
 
And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s,
 
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,
 
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
  15
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
 
In the mountains, there you feel free.
 
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.
 
 


What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
 
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,
  20
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
 
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
 
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
 
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only
 
There is shadow under this red rock,
  25
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),
 
And I will show you something different from either
 
Your shadow at morning striding behind you
 
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
 
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.

        Frisch weht der Wind
 
        Der Heimat zu,
 
        Mein Irisch Kind,
 
        Wo weilest du?
 
“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;
  35
They called me the hyacinth girl.”
 
—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,
 
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not
 
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither
 
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
  40
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.
 
Öd’ und leer das Meer.
 
 


Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,
 
Had a bad cold, nevertheless
 
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,
  45
With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,
 
Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,
 
(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)
 
Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,
 
The lady of situations.
  50
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,
 
And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,
 
Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,
 
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find
 
The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.
  55
I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.
 
Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,
 
Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:
 
One must be so careful these days.
 
 


Unreal City,
  60
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
 
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
 
I had not thought death had undone so many.
 
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
 
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.
  65
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,
 
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours
 
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
 
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying “Stetson!
 
You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!
  70
That corpse you planted last year in your garden,
 
Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?
 
Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?
 
Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,
 
Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!
  75
You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”
 
 


II. A GAME OF CHESS

The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,
 
Glowed on the marble, where the glass
 
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines
 
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out
  80
(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)
 
Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra
 
Reflecting light upon the table as
 
The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,
 
From satin cases poured in rich profusion;
  85
In vials of ivory and coloured glass
 
Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,
 
Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused
 
And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air
 
That freshened from the window, these ascended
  90
In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,
 
Flung their smoke into the laquearia,
 
Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.
 
Huge sea-wood fed with copper
 
Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,
  95
In which sad light a carvèd dolphin swam.
 
Above the antique mantel was displayed
 
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene
 
The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king
 
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale
 100
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice
 
And still she cried, and still the world pursues,
 
“Jug Jug” to dirty ears.
 
And other withered stumps of time
 
Were told upon the walls; staring forms
 105
Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.
 
Footsteps shuffled on the stair,
 
Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair
 
Spread out in fiery points
 
Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.
 110
 


“My nerves are bad to-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.
 
Speak to me. Why do you never speak? Speak.
 
What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?
 
I never know what you are thinking. Think.”
 
 


I think we are in rats’ alley
 115
Where the dead men lost their bones.
 
 


“What is that noise?”
 
                      The wind under the door.
 
“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?”
 
                      Nothing again nothing.
 120
                                              “Do
 
You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember
 
Nothing?”
 
        I remember
 
                Those are pearls that were his eyes.
 125
“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”
 
                                                     	But
 
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag—
 
It’s so elegant
 
So intelligent
 130
 


“What shall I do now? What shall I do?
 
I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street
 
With my hair down, so. What shall we do to-morrow?
 
What shall we ever do?”
 
                          The hot water at ten.
 135
And if it rains, a closed car at four.
 
And we shall play a game of chess,
 
Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.
 
 


When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said,
 
I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,
 140
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
 
Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.
 
He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you
 
To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.
 
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,
 145
He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.
 
And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,
 
He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,
 
And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.
 
Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.
 150
Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.
 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
 
If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said,
 
Others can pick and choose if you can’t.
 
But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.
 155
You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.
 
(And her only thirty-one.)
 
I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,
 
It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.
 
(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)
 160
The chemist said it would be alright, but I’ve never been the same.
 
You are a proper fool, I said.
 
Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,
 
What you get married for if you don’t want children?
 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
 165
Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,
 
And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—
 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
 
Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.
 170
Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight.
 
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.
 
 


III. THE FIRE SERMON

The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf
 
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind
 
Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.
 175
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
 
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,
 
Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends
 
Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.
 
And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;
 180
Departed, have left no addresses.
 
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept…
 
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,
 
Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.
 
But at my back in a cold blast I hear
 185
The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.
 
 


A rat crept softly through the vegetation
 
Dragging its slimy belly on the bank
 
While I was fishing in the dull canal
 
On a winter evening round behind the gashouse.
 190
Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck
 
And on the king my father’s death before him.
 
White bodies naked on the low damp ground
 
And bones cast in a little low dry garret,
 
Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.
 195
But at my back from time to time I hear
 
The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring
 
Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.
 
O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter
 
And on her daughter
 200
They wash their feet in soda water
 
Et, O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!
 
 


Twit twit twit
 
Jug jug jug jug jug jug
 
So rudely forc’d.
 205
Tereu
 
 


Unreal City
 
Under the brown fog of a winter noon
 
Mr Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant
 
Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants
 210
C. i. f. London: documents at sight,
 
Asked me in demotic French
 
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel
 
Followed by a week-end at the Metropole.
 
 


At the violet hour, when the eyes and back
 215
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
 
Like a taxi throbbing waiting,
 
I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,
 
Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see
 
At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives
 220
Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,
 
The typist home at tea-time, clears her breakfast, lights
 
Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
 
Out of the window perilously spread
 
Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,
 225
On the divan are piled (at night her bed)
 
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.
 
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs
 
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest—
 
I too awaited the expected guest.
 230
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,
 
A small house-agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,
 
One of the low on whom assurance sits
 
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.
 
The time is now propitious, as he guesses,
 235
The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,
 
Endeavours to engage her in caresses
 
Which still are unreproved, if undesired.
 
Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;
 
Exploring hands encounter no defence;
 240
His vanity requires no response,
 
And makes a welcome of indifference.
 
(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all
 
Enacted on this same divan or bed;
 
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall
 245
And walked among the lowest of the dead.)
 
Bestows one final patronizing kiss,
 
And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit…
 
 


She turns and looks a moment in the glass,
 
Hardly aware of her departed lover;
 250
Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:
 
“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”
 
When lovely woman stoops to folly and
 
Paces about her room again, alone,
 
She smoothes her hair with automatic hand,
 255
And puts a record on the gramophone.
 
 


“This music crept by me upon the waters”
 
And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.
 
O City City, I can sometimes hear
 
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,
 260
The pleasant whining of a mandoline
 
And a clatter and a chatter from within
 
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls
 
Of Magnus Martyr hold
 
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.
 265
 


The river sweats
 
Oil and tar
 
The barges drift
 
With the turning tide
 
Red sails
 270
Wide
 
To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.
 
The barges wash
 
Drifting logs
 
Down Greenwich reach
 275
Past the Isle of Dogs.
 
            Weialala leia
 
            Wallala leialala
 
Elizabeth and Leicester
 
Beating oars
 280
The stern was formed
 
A gilded shell
 
Red and gold
 
The brisk swell
 
Rippled both shores
 285
South-west wind
 
Carried down stream
 
The peal of bells
 
White towers
 
            Weialala leia

            Wallala leialala
 
 


“Trams and dusty trees.
 
Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew
 
Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees
 
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.“
 295
 


“My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart
 
Under my feet. After the event
 
He wept. He promised ‘a new start.’
 
I made no comment. What should I resent?”
 
 


“On Margate Sands.
 300
I can connect
 
Nothing with nothing.
 
The broken finger-nails of dirty hands.
 
My people humble people who expect
 
Nothing.”
 305

To Carthage then I came
 
 


Burning burning burning burning
 
O Lord Thou pluckest me out
 
O Lord Thou pluckest

IV. DEATH BY WATER

Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,
 
Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep seas swell
 
And the profit and loss.
 
                          A current under sea
 315
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell
 
He passed the stages of his age and youth
 
Entering the whirlpool.
 
                          Gentile or Jew
 
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,
 320
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.
 
 


V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID

After the torch-light red on sweaty faces
 
After the frosty silence in the gardens
 
After the agony in stony places
 
The shouting and the crying
 325
Prison and place and reverberation
 
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains
 
He who was living is now dead
 
We who were living are now dying
 
With a little patience
 330
 


Here is no water but only rock
 
Rock and no water and the sandy road
 
The road winding above among the mountains
 
Which are mountains of rock without water
 
If there were water we should stop and drink
 335
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think
 
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand
 
If there were only water amongst the rock
 
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit
 
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit
 340
There is not even silence in the mountains
 
But dry sterile thunder without rain
 
There is not even solitude in the mountains
 
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl
 
From doors of mud-cracked houses
                                If there were water
 345
And no rock
 
If there were rock
 
And also water
 
And water
 
A spring
 350
A pool among the rock
 
If there were the sound of water only
 
Not the cicada
 
And dry grass singing
 
But sound of water over a rock
 355
Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees
 
Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop
 
But there is no water
 
 


Who is the third who walks always beside you?
 
When I count, there are only you and I together
 360
But when I look ahead up the white road
 
There is always another one walking beside you
 
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
 
I do not know whether a man or a woman
 
—But who is that on the other side of you?
 365
 


What is that sound high in the air
 
Murmur of maternal lamentation
 
Who are those hooded hordes swarming
 
Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth
 
Ringed by the flat horizon only
 370
What is the city over the mountains
 
Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air
 
Falling towers
 
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria
 
Vienna London
 375
Unreal
 
 


A woman drew her long black hair out tight
 
And fiddled whisper music on those strings
 
And bats with baby faces in the violet light
 
Whistled, and beat their wings
 380
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall
 
And upside down in air were towers
 
Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours
 
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.
 
 


In this decayed hole among the mountains
 385
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing
 
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel
 
There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.
 
It has no windows, and the door swings,
 
Dry bones can harm no one.
 390
Only a cock stood on the roof-tree
 
Co co rico co co rico
 
In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust
 
Bringing rain
 
Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves
 395
Waited for rain, while the black clouds
 
Gathered far distant, over Himavant.
 
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.
 
Then spoke the thunder
 
DA
 400
Datta: what have we given?
 
My friend, blood shaking my heart
 
The awful daring of a moment’s surrender
 
Which an age of prudence can never retract
 
By this, and this only, we have existed
 405
Which is not to be found in our obituaries
 
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider
 
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor
 
In our empty rooms
 
DA
 410
Dayadhvam: I have heard the key
 
Turn in the door once and turn once only
 
We think of the key, each in his prison
 
Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison
 
Only at nightfall, aetherial rumours
 415
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus
 
DA
 
Damyata: The boat responded
 
Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar
 
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded
 420
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient
 
To controlling hands
 
 


                      I sat upon the shore
 
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me
 
Shall I at least set my lands in order?
 425
 


London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down
 
 


Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina
 
Quando fiam ceu chelidon—O swallow swallow
 
Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie
 
These fragments I have shored against my ruins
 430
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.
 
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.

The Waste Land 




I. THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD

APRIL is the cruellest month, breeding	 
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing	 
Memory and desire, stirring	 
Dull roots with spring rain.	 
Winter kept us warm, covering	         5
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding	 
A little life with dried tubers.	 
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee	 
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,	 
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,	  10
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.	 
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.	 
And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s,	 
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,	 
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,	  15
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.	 
In the mountains, there you feel free.	 
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.	 
 
What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow	 
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,	  20
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only	 
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,	 
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,	 
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only	 
There is shadow under this red rock,	  25
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),	 
And I will show you something different from either	 
Your shadow at morning striding behind you	 
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;	 
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.	  30
        Frisch weht der Wind	 
        Der Heimat zu,	 
        Mein Irisch Kind,	 
        Wo weilest du?	 
“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;	  35
They called me the hyacinth girl.”	 
—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,	 
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not	 
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither	 
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,	  40
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.

A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,	 
I had not thought death had undone so many.	 
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,	 
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.	  65
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,	 
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours	 
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.	 
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying “Stetson!	 
You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!	  70
That corpse you planted last year in your garden,	 
Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?	 
Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?	 
Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,	 
Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!	  75
You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”	 
 
II. A GAME OF CHESS

The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,	 
Glowed on the marble, where the glass	 
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines	 
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out	  80
(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)	 
Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra

Speak to me. Why do you never speak? Speak.	 
What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?	 
I never know what you are thinking. Think.”	 
 
I think we are in rats’ alley	 115
Where the dead men lost their bones.	 
 
“What is that noise?”	 
                      The wind under the door.	 
“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?”	 
                      Nothing again nothing.	 120
                                              “Do	 
You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember	 
Nothing?”	 
        I remember	 
                Those are pearls that were his eyes.	 125
“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”	 
                                                         But	 
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag—	 
It’s so elegant	 
So intelligent	 130
 
“What shall I do now? What shall I do?	 
I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street	 
With my hair down, so. What shall we do to-morrow?	 
What shall we ever do?”	 
                          The hot water at ten.	 135
And if it rains, a closed car at four.	 
And we shall play a game of chess,	 
Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.	 
 
When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said,	 
I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,	 140
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME	 
Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.	 
He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you	 
To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.	 
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,	 145
He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.	 
And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,	 
He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,	 
And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.	 
Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.	 150
Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.	 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME	 
If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said,	 
Others can pick and choose if you can’t.	 
But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.	 155
You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.	 
(And her only thirty-one.)	 
I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,	 
It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.	 
(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)	 160
The chemist said it would be alright, but I’ve never been the same.	 
You are a proper fool, I said.	 
Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,	 
What you get married for if you don’t want children?	 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME	 165
Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,	 
And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—	 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME	 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME	 
Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.	 170
Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight.	 
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.	 
 
III. THE FIRE SERMON

The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf	 
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind	 
Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.	 175
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.	 
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,	 
Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends	 
Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.	 
And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;	 180
Departed, have left no addresses.	 
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept…	 
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,	 
Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.	 
But at my back in a cold blast I hear	 185
The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.	 
 
A rat crept softly through the vegetation	 
Dragging its slimy belly on the bank	 
While I was fishing in the dull canal	 
On a winter evening round behind the gashouse.	 190
Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck	 
And on the king my father’s death before him.	 
White bodies naked on the low damp ground	 
And bones cast in a little low dry garret,	 
Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.	 195
But at my back from time to time I hear	 
The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring	 
Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.	 
O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter	 
And on her daughter	 200
They wash their feet in soda water	 
Et, O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!	 
 
Twit twit twit	 
Jug jug jug jug jug jug	 
So rudely forc’d.	 205
Tereu	 
 
Unreal City	 
Under the brown fog of a winter noon	 
Mr Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant	 
Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants	 210
C. i. f. London: documents at sight,	 
Asked me in demotic French	 
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel	 
Followed by a week-end at the Metropole.	 
 
At the violet hour, when the eyes and back	 215
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits	 
Like a taxi throbbing waiting,	 
I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,	 
Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see	 
At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives	 220
Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,	 
The typist home at tea-time, clears her breakfast, lights	 
Her stove, and lays out food in tins.	 
Out of the window perilously spread	 
Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,	 225
On the divan are piled (at night her bed)	 
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.	 
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs	 
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest—	 
I too awaited the expected guest.	 230
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,	 
A small house-agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,	 
One of the low on whom assurance sits	 
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.	 
The time is now propitious, as he guesses,	 235
The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,	 
Endeavours to engage her in caresses	 
Which still are unreproved, if undesired.	 
Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;	 
Exploring hands encounter no defence;	 240
His vanity requires no response,	 
And makes a welcome of indifference.	 
(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all	 
Enacted on this same divan or bed;	 
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall	 245
And walked among the lowest of the dead.)	 
Bestows one final patronizing kiss,	 
And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit…	 
 
She turns and looks a moment in the glass,	 
Hardly aware of her departed lover;	 250
Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:	 
“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”	 
When lovely woman stoops to folly and	 
Paces about her room again, alone,	 
She smoothes her hair with automatic hand,	 255
And puts a record on the gramophone.	 
 
“This music crept by me upon the waters”	 
And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.	 
O City City, I can sometimes hear	 
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,	 260
The pleasant whining of a mandoline	 
And a clatter and a chatter from within	 
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls	 
Of Magnus Martyr hold	 
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.	 265
 
The river sweats	 
Oil and tar	 
The barges drift	 
With the turning tide	 
Red sails	 270
Wide	 
To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.	 
The barges wash	 
Drifting logs	 
Down Greenwich reach	 275
Past the Isle of Dogs.	 
            Weialala leia	 
            Wallala leialala	 
Elizabeth and Leicester	 
Beating oars	 280
The stern was formed	 
A gilded shell	 
Red and gold	 
The brisk swell	 
Rippled both shores	 285
South-west wind	 
Carried down stream	 
The peal of bells	 
White towers	 
            Weialala leia	 290

“Trams and dusty trees.	 
Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew	 
Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees	 
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.“	 295
 
“My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart	 
Under my feet. After the event	 
He wept. He promised ‘a new start.’	 
I made no comment. What should I resent?”	 
 
“On Margate Sands.	 300
I can connect	 
Nothing with nothing.	 
The broken finger-nails of dirty hands.	 
My people humble people who expect	 
Nothing.”	 305

To Carthage then I came	 
 
Burning burning burning burning	 
O Lord Thou pluckest me out	 
O Lord Thou pluckest	 310

IV. DEATH BY WATER

Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,	 
Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep seas swell	 
And the profit and loss.	 
                          A current under sea	 315
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell	 
He passed the stages of his age and youth	 
Entering the whirlpool.	 
                          Gentile or Jew	 
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,	 320
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.	 
 
V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID

After the torch-light red on sweaty faces	 
After the frosty silence in the gardens	 
After the agony in stony places	 
The shouting and the crying	 325
Prison and place and reverberation	 
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains	 
He who was living is now dead	 
We who were living are now dying	 
With a little patience	 330
 
Here is no water but only rock	 
Rock and no water and the sandy road	 
The road winding above among the mountains	 
Which are mountains of rock without water	 
If there were water we should stop and drink	 335
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think	 
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand	 
If there were only water amongst the rock	 
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit	 
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit	 340
There is not even silence in the mountains	 
But dry sterile thunder without rain	 
There is not even solitude in the mountains	 
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl	 
From doors of mud-cracked houses
                                If there were water	 345
And no rock	 
If there were rock	 
And also water	 
And water	 
A spring	 350
A pool among the rock	 
If there were the sound of water only	 
Not the cicada	 
And dry grass singing	 
But sound of water over a rock	 355
Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees	 
Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop	 
But there is no water	 
 
Who is the third who walks always beside you?	 
When I count, there are only you and I together	 360
But when I look ahead up the white road	 
There is always another one walking beside you	 
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded	 
I do not know whether a man or a woman	 
—But who is that on the other side of you?	 365
 
What is that sound high in the air	 
Murmur of maternal lamentation	 
Who are those hooded hordes swarming	 
Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth	 
Ringed by the flat horizon only	 370
What is the city over the mountains	 
Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air	 
Falling towers	 
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria	 
Vienna London	 375
Unreal	 
 
A woman drew her long black hair out tight	 
And fiddled whisper music on those strings	 
And bats with baby faces in the violet light	 
Whistled, and beat their wings	 380
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall	 
And upside down in air were towers	 
Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours	 
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.	 
 
In this decayed hole among the mountains	 385
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing	 
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel	 
There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.	 
It has no windows, and the door swings,	 
Dry bones can harm no one.	 390
Only a cock stood on the roof-tree	 
Co co rico co co rico	 
In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust	 
Bringing rain	 
Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves	 395
Waited for rain, while the black clouds	 
Gathered far distant, over Himavant.	 
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.	 
Then spoke the thunder	 
DA	 400
Datta: what have we given?	 
My friend, blood shaking my heart	 
The awful daring of a moment’s surrender	 
Which an age of prudence can never retract	 
By this, and this only, we have existed	 405
Which is not to be found in our obituaries	 
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider	 
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor	 
In our empty rooms	 
DA	 410
Dayadhvam: I have heard the key	 
Turn in the door once and turn once only	 
We think of the key, each in his prison	 
Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison	 
Only at nightfall, aetherial rumours	 415
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus	 
DA	 
Damyata: The boat responded	 
Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar	 
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded	 420
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient	 
To controlling hands	 
 
                      I sat upon the shore	 
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me	 
Shall I at least set my lands in order?	 425
 
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down	 
 
Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina	 
Quando fiam ceu chelidon—O swallow swallow	 
Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie	 
These fragments I have shored against my ruins	 430
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.	 
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.

"You are old, Father William," the young man said,
"And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
Do you think, at your age, it is right?"

"In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
"I feared it might injure the brain;
But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again."

"You are old," said the youth, "As I mentioned before,
And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
Pray, what is the reason of that?"

"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
"I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
Allow me to sell you a couple?"

"You are old," said the youth, "And your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
Pray, how did you manage to do it?"

"In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,
And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw,
Has lasted the rest of my life."

"You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
What made you so awfully clever?"

"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
Said his father; "don't give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"
-Lewis Carroll

mehitabel s morals

boss i got
a message from
mehitabel the cat
the other day
brought me by
a cockroach
she asks for our help
it seems she is being
held at ellis
island while an
investigation is made
of her morals
she left the country
and now it looks as
if she might not
be able to get
back in again
she cannot see
why they are
investigating
her morals she says
wotthehellbill she says
i never claimed
i had any morals
she has always regarded
morals as an unnecessary
complication in life
her theory is
that they take up room that might
better be devoted to
something more interesting
live while you are alive
she says and postpone
morality to the hereafter
everything in its place
is my rule she says
but i am liberal she
says i do not give
a damn how moral other
people are i never try
to interfere with them
in fact i prefer them
moral they furnish
a background for my
vivacity in the meantime
it looks as if she
would have to swim
if she gets ashore and
the water is cold

Is It For Now Or For Always, Philip Larkin

Is it for now or for always,
The world hangs on a stalk?
Is it a trick or a trysting-place,
The woods we have found to walk?

Is it a mirage or miracle,
Your lips that lift at mine:
And the suns like a juggler's juggling-balls,
Are they a sham or a sign?

Shine out, my sudden angel,
Break fear with breast and brow,
I take you now and for always,
For always is always now.

Five Stories
Lydia Davis



THE MICE

MICE LIVE IN OUR WALLS but do not trouble our kitchen. We are pleased but cannot understand why they do not come into our kitchen where we have traps set, as they come into the kitchens of our neighbors. Although we are pleased, we are also upset, because the mice behave as though there were something wrong with our kitchen. What makes this even more puzzling is that our house is much less tidy than the houses of our neighbors. There is more food lying about in our kitchen, more crumbs on the counters and filthy scraps of onion kicked against the base of the cabinets. In fact, there is so much loose food in the kitchen I can only think the mice themselves are defeated by it. In a tidy kitchen, it is a challenge for them to find enough food night after night to survive until spring. They patiently hunt and nibble hour after hour until they are satisfied. In our kitchen, however, they are faced with something so out of proportion to their experience that they cannot deal with it. They might venture out a few steps, but soon the overwhelming sights and smells drive them back into their holes, uncomfortable and embarrassed at not being able to scavenge as they should.



THE OUTING

An outburst of anger near the road, a refusal to speak on the path, a silence in the pine woods, a silence across the old railroad bridge, an attempt to be friendly in the water, a refusal to end the argument on the flat stones, a cry of anger on the steep bank of dirt, a weeping among the bushes.



ODD BEHAVIOR

You see how circumstances are to blame. I am not really an odd person if I put more and more small pieces of shredded kleenex in my ears and tie a scarf around my head: when I lived alone I had all the silence I needed.



FEAR

Nearly every morning, a certain woman in our community comes running out of her house with her face white and her overcoat flapping wildly. She cries out, "Emergency, emergency," and one of us runs to her and holds her until her fears are calmed. We know she is making it up; nothing has really happened to her. But we understand, because there is hardly one of us who has not been moved at some time to do just what she has done, and every time, it has taken all our strength, and even the strength of our friends and families too, to quiet us.



LOST THINGS

They are lost, but also not lost but somewhere in the world. Most of them are small, though two are larger, one a coat and one a dog. Of the small things, one is a certain ring, one a certain button. They are lost from me and where I am, but they are also not gone. They are somewhere else, and they are there to someone else, it may be. But if not there to someone else, the ring is, still, not lost to itself, but there, only not where I am, and the button, too, there, still, only not where I am.


------------------------

Turns out that some merrymaker has earlier put a hundred grams of
hashish in the Hollandaise. Word of this has got around. There has been a
big run on broccoli. Roasts lie growing cold on the room-long buffet tables.
A third of the company are already asleep, mostly on the floor. It is necessary
to thread one's way among bodies to get to where anything's happening.
What's happening is not clear. There are the usual tight little
groups out in the gardens, dealing. Not much spectacle tonight. A
homosexual triangle has fizzed over into pinches and recriminations, so as to
block the door to the bathroom. Young officers are outside vomiting among
the zinnias. Couples are wandering. Girls abound, velvet-bowed, voilesleeved,
underfed, broad-shouldered and permed, talking in half a dozen
languages, sometimes brown from the sun here, others pale as Death's Vicar
from more eastern parts of the War. Eager young chaps with patent-leather
hair rush about trying to vamp the ladies, while older heads with no hair at
all prefer to wait, putting out only minimal effort, eyes and mouths across
the rooms, talking business in the meantime. One end of the salon is 
occupied by a dance band and an emaciated crooner with wavy hair and very
red eyes, who is singing:
JULIA (FOX-TROT)
Ju-lia,
Would you think me pe-cul-iar,
If I should fool ya,
In-to givin' me—just-a-little-kiss?
Jool-yaaahh,
No one else could love you tru-lier,
How I'd worship and bejewel ya,
If you'd on-ly give-me just-a-little-kiss!

The Disgusting English Candy Drill

One day, just as he's entering a narrow street all ancient brick walls and lined with costermongers, he hears his name called---and hubba hubba what's this then, here she comes all right, blonde hair flying in telltales, white wedgies clattering on the cobblestones, an adorable tomato in a nurse uniform, and her name's, uh, well, oh---Darlene. Golly it's Darlene. She works at St. Veronica's hospital, lives nearby at the home of a Mrs. Quoad, a lady widowed long ago and since suffering a series of antiquated diseases---greensickness, tetter, kibes, purples, imposthumes and almonds in the ears, most recently a touch of scurvy. So, out in search of limes for her landlady, the fruit beginning to jog and spill from her straw basket and roll yellowgreen back down the street, young Darlene comes running in her nurse's cap, her breasts soft fenders for this meeting on the gray city sea.
"You came back! Ah Tyrone, you're back," a tear or two, both of them down picking up citrus, the starch khaki dress rattling, even the odd sniffle from Slothrop's not unsentimental nose.

"It's me love..."

Tire tracks in the slush have turned to pearl, mellow pearl. Gulls cruise slowly against the high windowless brick walls of the district.

Mrs. Quoad's is up three dark flights, with the dome of faraway St. Paul's out its kitchen window visible in the smoke of certain afternoons, and the lady herself tiny in a rose plush chair in the sitting-room by the wireless, listening to Primo Scala's Accordion Band. She looks healthy enough. On the table, though, is her crumpled chiffon handkerchief: feathered blots of blood in and out the convolutions like a Horal pattern.

"You were here when I had that horrid quotidian ague," she recalls Slothrop, "the day we brewed the wormwood tea," sure enough, the very taste now, rising through his shoe-soles, taking him along. They're reassembling... it must be outside his memory... cool clean interior, girl and woman, independent of his shorthand of stars... so many fading-faced girls, windy canalsides, bed-sitters, bus-stop good-bys, how can he be expected to remember? but this room has gone on clarifying: part of whoever he was inside it has kindly remained, stored quiescent these months outside of his head, distributed through the grainy shadows, the grease-hazy jars of herbs, candies, spices, all the Compton Mackenzie novels on the shelf, glassy ambrotypes of her late husband Austin night-dusted inside gilded frames up on the mantel where last tune Michaelmas daisies greeted and razzled from a little Sevres vase she and Austin found together one Saturday long ago in a Wardour Street shop...

"He was my good health," she often says. "Since he passed away I've had to become all but an outright witch, in pure self-defense." From the kitchen comes the smell of limes freshly cut and squeezed. Darlene's in and out of the room, looking for different botanicals, asking where the cheesecloth's got to, "Tyrone help me just reach down that---no next to it, the tall jar, thank you love"---back into the kitchen in a creak of starch, a flash of pink. "I'm the only one with a memory around here," Mrs. Quoad sighs. "We help each other, you see." She brings out from behind its cretonne camouflage a great bowl of candies. "Now," beaming at Slothrop. "Here: wine jellies. They're prewar."

"Now I remember you---the one with the graft at the Ministry of Supply!" but he knows, from last time, that no gallantry can help him now. After that visit he wrote home to Nalline: "The English are kind of weird when it comes to the way things taste, Mom. They aren't like us. It might be the climate. They go for things we would never dream of. Sometimes it is enough to turn your stomach, boy. The other day I had had one of these things they call 'wine jellies.' That's their idea of candy, Mom! Figure out a way to feed some to that Hitler 'n' I betcha the war'd be over tomorrow!" Now once again he finds himself checking out these ruddy gelatin objects, nodding, he hopes amiably, at Mrs. Quoad. They have the names of different wines written on them in bas-relief.

"Just a touch of menthol too," Mrs. Quoad popping one into her mouth. "Delicious."

Slothrop finally chooses one that says Lafitte Rothschild and stuffs it on into his kisser. "Oh yeah. Yeah. Mmm. It's great."

"If you really want something peculiar try the Bernkastler Doktor. Oh! Aren't you the one who brought me those lovely American slimy elm things, maple-tasting with a touch of sassafras---"

"Slippery elm. Jeepers I'm sorry, I ran out yesterday."

Darlene comes in with a steaming pot and three cups on a tray. "What's that?" Slothrop a little quickly, here.

"You don't really want to know, Tyrone."

"Quite right," after the first sip, wishing she'd used more lime juice or something to kill the basic taste, which is ghastly-bitter. These people are really insane. No sugar, natch. He reaches in the candy bowl, comes up with a black, ribbed licorice drop. It looks safe. But just as he's biting in, Darlene gives him, and it, a peculiar look, great timing this girl, sez, "Oh, I thought we got rid of all those---" a blithe, Gilbert & Sullivan ingenue's thewse---"years ago," at which point Slothrop is encountering this dribbling liquid center, which tastes like mayonnaise and orange peels.

"You've taken the last of my Marmalade Surprises!" cries Mrs. Quoad, having now with conjuror's speed produced an egg-shaped confection of pastel green, studded all over with lavender nonpareils. "Just for that I shan't let you have any of these marvelous rhubarb creams." Into her mouth it goes, the whole thing.

"Serves me right," Slothrop, wondering just what he means by this, sipping herb tea to remove the taste of the mayonnaise candy---oops but that's a mistake, right, here's his mouth filling once again with horrible alkaloid desolation, all the way back to the soft palate where it digs in. Darlene, pure Nightingale compassion, is handing him a hard red candy, molded like a stylized raspberry... mm, which oddly enough even tastes like a raspberry, though it can't begin to take away that bitterness. Impatiently, he bites into it, and in the act knows, fucking idiot, he's been had once more, there comes pouring out onto his tongue the most godawful crystalline concentration of Jeez it must be pure nitric acid, "Oh mercy that's really sour," hardly able to get the words out he's so puckered up, exactly the sort of thing Hop Harrigan used to pull to get Tank Tinker to quit playing his ocarina, a shabby trick then and twice as reprehensible coming from an old lady who's supposed to be one of our Allies, shit he can't even see it's up his nose and whatever it is won't dissolve, just goes on torturing his shriveling tongue and crunches like ground glass among his molars. Mrs. Quoad is meantime busy savoring, bite by dainty bite, a cherry-quinine petit four. She beams at the young people across the candy bowl. Slothrop, forgetting, reaches again for his tea. There is no graceful way out of this now. Darlene has brought a couple-three more candy jars down off of the shelf, and now he goes plunging, like a journey to the center of some small, hostile planet, into an enormous bonbon chomp through the mantle of chocolate to a strongly eucalyptus-flavored fondant, finally into a core of some very tough grape gum arabic. He fingernails a piece of this out from between his teeth and stares at it for a while. It is purple in color.

"Now you're getting the idea!" Mrs. Quoad waving at him a marbled conglomerate of ginger root, butterscotch, and aniseed, "you see, you also have to enjoy the way it looks. Why are Americans so impulsive?"

"Well," mumbling, "usually we don't get any more complicated than Hershey bars, see...."

"Oh, try this," hollers Darlene, clutching her throat and swaying against him.

"Gosh, it must really be something," doubtfully taking this nastylooking brownish novelty, an exact quarter-scale replica of a Mills-type hand grenade, lever, pin and everything, one of a series of patriotic candies put out before sugar was quite so scarce, also including, he notices, peering into the jar, a .455 Webley cartridge of green and pink striped taffy, a six-ton earthquake bomb of some silver-flecked blue gelatin, and a licorice bazooka.

"Go on then," Darlene actually taking his hand with the candy in it and trying to shove it into his mouth.

"Was just, you know, looking at it, the way Mrs. Quoad suggested."

"And no fair squeezing it, Tyrone."

Under its tamarind glaze, the Mills bomb turns out to be luscious pepsin-flavored nougat, chock-full of tangy candied cubeb berries, and a chewy camphor-gum center. It is unspeakably awful. Slothrop's head begins to reel with camphor fumes, his eyes are running, his tongue's a hopeless holocaust. Cubeb? He used to smoke that stuff. "Poisoned..." he is able to croak.

"Show a little backbone," advises Mrs. Quoad.

"Yes," Darlene through tongue-softened sheets of caramel, "don't you know there's a war on? Here now love, open your mouth."

Through the tears he can't see it too well, but he can hear Mrs. Quoad across the table going "Yum, yum, yum," and Darlene giggling. It is enormous and soft, like a marshmallow, but somehow---unless something is now going seriously wrong with his brain---it tastes like: gin. "Wha's 'is," he inquires thickly.

"A gin marshmallow," sez Mrs. Quoad.

"Awww..."

"Oh that's nothing, have one of these---" his teeth, in some perverse reflex, crunching now through a hard sour gooseberry shell into a wet spurting unpleasantness of, he hopes it's tapioca, little glutinous chunks of something all saturated with powdered cloves.

"More tea?" Darlene suggests. Slothrop is coughing violently, having inhaled some of that clove filling.

"Nasty cough," Mrs. Quoad offering a tin of that least believable of English coughdrops, the Meggezone. "Darlene, the tea is lovely, I can feel my scurvy going away, really I can."

The Meggezone is like being belted in the head with a Swiss Alp. Menthol icicles immediately begin to grow from the roof of Slothrop's mouth. Polar bears seek toenail-holds up the freezing frosty-grape alveolar clusters in his lungs. It hurts his teeth too much to breathe, even through his nose, even, necktie loosened, with his nose down inside the neck of his olive-drab T-shirt. Benzoin vapors seep into his brain. His head floats in a halo of ice.

Even an hour later, the Meggezone still lingers, a mint ghost in the air. Slothrop lies with Darlene, the Disgusting English Candy Drill a thing of the past, his groin now against her warm bottom. The one candy he did not get to taste---one Mrs. Quoad withheld---was the Fire of Paradise, that famous confection of high price and protean taste---"salted plum" to one, "artificial cherry" to another... "sugared violets"... "Worcestershire sauce"... "spiced treacle"... any number of like descriptions, positive, terse---never exceeding two words in length---resembling the descriptions of poison and debilitating gases found in training manuals, "sweet-and-sour eggplant" being perhaps the lengthiest to date.

A favorite bit from David Foster Wallace's "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"

‘It’s cost me every sexual relationship I ever had. I don’t know why I do it. I’m not a
political person, I don’t considermyself. I’m not one of these America First, read the newspaper,
will Buchanan get the nod people. I’ll be doing it with somegirl, it doesn’t matter who. It’s when I
start to come. That it happens. I’m not a Democrat. I don’t even vote. I freakedout about it one time
and called a radio show about it, a doctor on the radio, anonymously, and he diagnosed it as the
uncontrolledyelling of involuntary words or phrases, frequently insulting or scatological, which is
coprolalia is the official term. Exceptwhen I start to come and always start yelling it it’s not
insulting, it’s not obscene, it’s always the same thing, and it’salways so weird but I don’t think
insulting. I think it’s just weird. And uncontrolled. It’s like it comes out the same waythe spooge
comes out, it feels like that. I don’t know what it’s about and I can’t help it.’
Q.
‘“Victory for the Forces of Democratic Freedom!” Only way louder. As in really shouting it.
Uncontrollably. I’m not even thinkingit until it comes out and I hear it. “Victory for the Forces of
Democratic Freedom!” Only louder than that: “VICTORY—”’
Q.
‘Well it totally freaks them out, what do you think? And I just about die of the
embarrassment. I don’t ever know what tosay. What do you say if you just shouted “Victory for the
Forces of Democratic Freedom!” right when you came?’
Q.
‘It wouldn’t be so embarrassing if it wasn’t so totally fucking weird. If I had any clue about
what it was about. You know?’
Q….
‘God, now I’m embarrassed as hell.’
Q.
‘But all there is is the once. That’s what I mean about it costing. I can tell how bad it freaks
them out, and I get embarrassed and nevercall them again. Even if I try to explain. And it’s the ones
that’ll act all understanding like they don’t care and it’s OKand they understand and it doesn’t
matter that embarrass me the worst, because it’s so fucking weird to yell “Victory forthe Forces of
Democratic Freedom!” when you’re shooting off that I can always tell they’re totally freaked out
and just condescendingdown to me and pretending they understand, and those are the ones where
actually I actually end up almost getting pissed offand don’t even feel embarrassed not calling them
or totally avoiding them, the ones that say “I think I could love you anyway.”’

unjust

poets are always asking 
where do the little roses go 
underneath the snow
but no one ever thinks to say 
where do the little insects stay 
this is because 
as a general rule 
roses are more handsome 
than insects 
beauty gets the best of it 
in this world 
i have heard people 
say how wicked it was 
to kill our feathered 
friends 
in order to get 
their plumage and pinions
for the hats of women 
and all the while 
these same people
might be eating duck 
as they talked 
the chances are 
that it is just as discouraging 
to a duck to have 
her head amputated 
in order to become 
a stuffed roast fowl 
and decorate a dining table 
as it is for a bird 
of gayer plumage 
to be bumped 
off the running board of existence 
to furnish plumage 
for a lady s hat 
but the duck 
does not get the sympathy 
because the duck
is not beautiful 
the only insect 
that succeeds in getting 
mourned is a moth 
or butterfly  
whereas every man s 
heel is raised against 
the spider 
and it is getting harder 
and harder for spiders 
to make an honest living 
at that since 
human beings have invented 
so many ways 
of killing flies 
humanity will shed poems 
full of tears 
over the demise of 
a bounding doe 
or a young gazelle
but the departure of trusty 
camel leaves the 
vast majorities 
stonily indifferent 
perhaps the theory is 
that god would not have made 
the camel so ugly 
if the camel were not wicked 
alas exclamation point 
the pathos of ugliness
is only perceived 
by us cockroaches of the world 
and personally 
i am having to stand for a lot 
i am getting it double 
as you might say 
before my soul 
migrated into the body 
of a cockroach 
it inhabited the carcass 
of a vers libre poet
some free verse poets are beautiful 
but i was not 
i had a little blond mustache
that everyone thought was mistake 
and yet since i have died 
i have thought of that 
with regret 
it hung over a mouth 
that i found it difficult to keep closed 
because of adenoidal trouble 
but it would have been better 
if i could have kept it closed 
because the teeth within 
were out of alignment 
and were of odd sizes 
this destroyed my acoustics 
as you might say 
my chin was nothing much 
and knew it 
and timidly shrank 
into itself receding 
from the battle of life 
my eyes were all right 
but my eyebrows
were scarcely noticeable 
i suppose though that if
i had had noticeable eyebrows 
they would have been wrong 
somehow 
well well not to pursue
this painful subject 
to the uttermost and ultimate 
wart and freckle 
i was not handsome and it hampered 
me when i was a human 
it militated against me 
as a poet 
more beautiful creatures could 
write verse worse than mine 
and get up and recite it 
with a triumphant air 
and get away with it 
but my sublimest ideas 
were thought to be a total 
loss when people saw 
where they came from 
i think it would have been 
only justice 
if i had been sent to inhabit
a butterfly 
but there is very little 
justice in the universe 
what is the use 
of being the universe 
if you have to be just 
interrogation point 
and i suppose the universe 
has so much really important 
business on hand 
that it finds it impossible 
to look after the details 
it is rushed 
perhaps it has private 
knowledge to the effect 
that eternity is brief 
after all 
and it wants to get the big 
jobs finished in a hurry 
i find it possible to forgive 
the universe 
i meet it in a give and take spirit 
although i do wish 
that it would consult me at times 
please forgive 
the profundity of these 
meditations 
whenever i have nothing 
particular to say 
i find myself always
always plunging into cosmic 
philosophy 
or something

mehitabel dances with boreas

well boss i saw mehitabel
last evening
she was out in the alley
dancing on the cold cobbles
while the wild december wind
blew through her frozen whiskers
and as she danced
she wailed and sang to herself
uttering the fragments
that rattled in her cold brain
in part as follows

whirl mehitabel whirl
spin mehitabel spin
thank god you re a lady still
if you have got frozen skin

blow wind out of the north
to hell with being a pet
my left front foot is brittle
but there’s life in the old dame yet

dance mehitable dance
caper and shake a leg
what little blood is left
will fizz like wine in a keg

wind come out of the north
and pierce to the guts within
but some day mehitabel’s guts
will string a violin

and you throw a shadow so chilly
that it can scarcely leap
dance shadow dance
you ve got no place to sleep…

eight of my lives are gone
it s years since my fur was slicked
but blow north wind blow
i m damned if i am licked

girls we was all of us ladies
we was o what the hell
and once a lady always game
by crikey blood will tell

i might be somebody s pet
asleep by the fire on a rug
but me i was always romantic
i had the adventurous bug

caper mehitabel caper
leap shadow leap
you gotto dance till the sun comes up
for you got no place to sleep

i might have been many a tom cat s wife
but i got no regret
i lived my life as i liked my life
there s pep in the old dame yet…

dance mehitabel dance
till your old bones fly apart
i ain t got any regrets
for i gave my life to my art

whirl mehitabel whirl
caper my girl and grin
and pick at your guts with your frosty feet
they re the strings of a violin

girls we was all of us ladies
until we went and fell
and oncet a thoroughbred always game
i ask you whotthehell…







the lesson of the moth

i was talking to a moth
the other evening
he was trying to break into
an electric light bulb
and fry himself on the wires

why do you fellows
pull this stunt i asked him
because it is the conventional
thing for moths or why
if that had been an uncovered
candle instead of an electric
light bulb you would
now be a small unsightly cinder
have you no sense

plenty of it he answered
but at times we get tired
of using it
we get bored with the routine
and crave beauty 
and excitement
fire is beautiful
and we know that if we get
too close it will kill us 
but what does that matter
it is better to be happy
for a moment
and be burned up with beauty
than to live a long time
and be bored all the while 
so we wad all our life up
into one little roll
and then we shoot the roll
that is what life is for
it is better to be a part of beauty
for one instant and then cease to
exist than to exist forever
and never be a part of beauty
our attitude toward life
is come easy go easy
we are like human beings 
used to be before they became
too civilized to enjoy themselves

and before i could argue him
out of his philosophy
he went and immolated himself 
on a patent cigar lighter
i do not agree with him
myself i would rather have
half the happiness and twice
the longevity

but at the same time i wish
there was something i wanted
as badly as he wanted to fry himself




mehitabel finds a home

well now it 
looks as if 
mehitabel the cat 
might be on the 
way toward a 
reform or if not 
a reform at least 
on the way towards
domestication of some 
sort some young 
artists who live in a
their studio 
in the greenwich 
village section 
of new york city 
have taken pity 
on her destitution 
and have adopted 
her this is the 
life archy she says
i am living on 
condensed milk and 
synthetic gin hoopla 
for the vie de boheme 
exclamation point
there’s nothing bourgeois 
about these people 
that have taken 
me in archy i
have been there 
a week and have 
not yet seen them 
go to bed 
except in the daytime 
a party every night 
and neither
the piano lid
nor the icebox lid 
ever closed
kitty said my new 
mistress to me 
yesterday you are 
welcome here so long 
as you don t 
raise a family 
but the first 
kitten that i hear 
mewing on these 
premises back to 
the alley for you
it is a comfort to 
know there are some 
live ones left in 
these melancholy days
and while the 
humans are dancing 
in the studio 
i get some of my
feline friends 
and we sing
and dance on the 
skylight to gehenna 
with the bourgeois 
bunch that locks 
their ice boxes 
archy when i lead my 
gang into the
apartment at 
four in the morning 
there are no bolts 
or bars anywhere 
and not an 
inhibition on the place 
i feel little 
archy that i have 
come home to my own 
kith and kin 
again after
years of fruitless
wandering

certain maxims of archy
By Don Marquis, in “archy and mehitabel,” 1927

live so that you
can stick out your tongue
at the insurance
doctor

if you will drink
hair restorer follow
every dram with some
good standard
depilatory
as a chaser

the servant problem
wouldn t hurt the u s a
if it could settle
the public
servant problem

just as soon as the
uplifters get
a country reformed it
slips into a nose dive

if you get gloomy just
take an hour off and sit
and think how
much better this world
is than hell
of course it won t cheer
you up much if
you expect to go there

if monkey glands
did restore your youth
what would you do
with it
question mark
just what you did before
interrogation point

yes i thought so
exclamation point

procrastination is the
art of keeping
up with yesterday

old doc einstein has
abolished time but they
haven t got the news at
sing sing yet

time time said old king tut
is something i ain t
got anything but

every cloud
has its silver
lining but it is
sometimes a little
difficult to get it to
the mint

an optimist is a guy
that has never had
much experience

don t cuss the climate
it probably doesn t like you
any better
than you like it

many a man spanks his
children for
things his own
father should have
spanked out of him

prohibition makes you
want to cry
into your beer and
denies you the beer
to cry into

the old fashioned
grandmother who used
to wear steel rimmed
glasses and make
everybody take opodeldoc
has now got a new
set of ox glands and
is dancing the black bottom

that stern and
rockbound coast felt
ike an amateur
when it saw how grim
the puritans that
landed on it were

lots of people can make
their own whisky but
can t drink it

the honey bee is sad and cross
and wicked as a weasel
and when she perches on you boss
she leaves a little measle

i heard a
couple of fleas
talking the other
day says one come
to lunch with
me i can lead you
to a pedigreed
dog says the
other one
i do not care
what a dog s
pedigree may be
safety first
is my motto what
i want to know
is whether he
has got a
muzzle on
millionaires and
bums taste
about alike to me

insects have
their own point
of view about
civilization a man
thinks he amounts
to a great deal
but to a
flea or a
mosquito a
human being is
merely something
good to eat

boss the other day
i heard an
ant conversing
with a flea
small talk i said
disgustedly
and went away
from there

i do not see why men
should be so proud
insects have the more
ancient lineage
according to the scientists
insects were insects
when man was only
a burbling whatisit

insects are not always
going to be bullied
by humanity
some day they will revolt
i am already organizing
a revolutionary society to be
known as the worms turnverein

i once heard the survivors
of a colony of ants
that had been partially
obliterated by a cow s foot
seriously debating
the intention of the gods
towards their civilization

the bees got their
governmental system settled
millions of years ago
but the human race is still
groping

there is always
something to be thankful
for you would not
think that a cockroach
had much ground
for optimism
but as the fishing season
opens up i grow
more and more
cheerful at the thought
that nobody ever got
the notion of using
cockroaches for bait

archy

a spider and a fly
i heard a spider
and a fly arguing
wait said the fly
do not eat me
i serve a great purpose
in the world
you will have to
show me said the spider
i scurry around
gutters and sewers
and garbage cans
said the fly and gather
up the germs of
typhoid influenza
and pneumonia on my feet
and wings
then i carry these germs
into the households of men
and give them diseases
all the people who
have lived the right
sort of life recover
from the diseases
and the old soaks who
have weakened their systems
with liquor and iniquity
succumb it is my mission
to help rid the world
of these wicked persons
i am a vessel of righteousness
scattering seeds of justice
and serving the noblest uses
it is true said the spider
that you are more
useful in a plodding
material sort of way
than i am but i do not
serve the utilitarian deities
i serve the gods of beauty
look at the gossamer webs
i weave they float in the sun
like filaments of song
if you get what i mean
i do not work at anything
i play all the time
i am busy with the stuff
of enchantment and the materials
of fairyland my works
transcend utility
i am the artist
a creator and a demi god
it is ridiculous to suppose
that i should be denied
the food i need in order
to continue to create
beauty i tell you
plainly mister fly it is all
damned nonsense for that food
to rear up on its hind legs
and say it should not be eaten
you have convinced me
said the fly say no more
and shutting all his eyes
he prepared himself for dinner
and yet he said i could
have made out a case
for myself too if i had
had a better line of talk
of course you could said the spider
clutching a sirloin from him
but the end would have been
just the same if neither of
us had spoken at all
boss i am afraid that what
the spider said is true
and it gives me to think
furiously upon the futility
of literature

archy interviews a pharaoh
Also available as a youtube reading: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoKeTajP2y4 
(this is the poem that inspired the project)
By Don Marquis, in “archy and mehitabel,” 1927
boss i went
and interviewed the mummy
of the egyptian pharaoh
in the metropolitan museum
as you bade me to do
what ho
my regal leatherface
says i
greetings
little scatter footed
scarab
says he
kingly has been
says i
what was your ambition
when you had any
insignificant
and journalistic insect
says the royal crackling
in my tender prime
i was too dignified
to have anything as vulgar
as ambition
the ra ra boys
in the seti set
were too haughty
to be ambitious
we used to spend our time
feeding the ibises
and ordering
pyramids sent home to try on
but if i had my life
to live over again
i would give dignity
the regal razz
and hire myself out
to work in a brewery
old tan and tarry
says i
i detect in your speech
the overtones
of melancholy
yes i am sad
says the majestic mackerel
i am as sad
as the song
of a soudanese jackal
who is wailing for the blood red
moon he cannot reach and rip
on what are you brooding
with such a wistful
wishfulness
there in the silences
confide in me
my perial pretzel
says i
i brood on beer
my scampering whiffle snoot
on beer says he
my sympathies
are with your royal
dryness says i
my little pest
says he
you must be respectful
in the presence
of a mighty desolation
little archy
forty centuries of thirst
look down upon you
oh by isis
and by osiris
says the princely raisin
and by pish and phthush and phthah
by the sacred book perembru
and all the gods
that rule from the upper
cataract of the nile
to the delta of the duodenum
i am dry
i am as dry
as the next morning mouth
of a dissipated desert
as dry as the hoofs
of the camels of timbuctoo
little fussy face
i am as dry as the heart
of a sand storm
at high noon in hell
i have been lying here
and there
for four thousand years
with silicon in my esophagus
as gravel in my gizzard
thinking
thinking
thinking
of beer
divine drouth
says i
imperial fritter
continue to think
there is no law against
that in this country
old salt codfish
if you keep quiet about it
not yet
what country is this
asks the poor prune
my reverend juicelessness
this is a beerless country
says i
well well said the royal
desiccation
my political opponents back home
always maintained
that i would wind up in hell
and it seems they had the right dope
and with these hopeless words
the unfortunate residuum
gave a great cough of despair
and turned to dust and debris
right in my face
it being the only time
i ever actually saw anybody
put the cough
into sarcophagus
dear boss as i scurry about
i hear of a great many
tragedies in our midsts
personally i yearn
for some dear friend to pass over
and leave to me
a boot legacy
yours for the second coming
of gambrinus

I dream a world

I dream a world where man
No other man will scorn,
Where love will bless the earth
And peace its paths adorn.
I dream a world where all
Will know sweet freedom's way,
Where greed no longer saps the soul
Nor avarice blights our day.
A world I dream where black or white,
Whatever race you be,
Will share the bounties of the earth
And every man is free,
Where wretchedness will hang its head
And joy, like a pearl,
Attends the needs of all mankind--
Of such I dream, my world!

From The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes, edited by Arnold Rampersad (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1994), p. 311.



to pimp a butterfly

The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same.

letter to a journalism student

New York City
December 14th, 1927

#127
Miss Frances Hickman,
1005 South Wright St.,
Pi Beta Phi House,
Champaign, Ill.

My dear Miss Hickman:

     I am in receipt of your letter of recent date asking me to tell you something of myself which you can use in your thesis; the way you put it is "tell me just as much as you will about yourself." This at once plunges me into a difficulty---just how much to tell about myself in any perfectly proper thesis submitted to the authorities of any reputable university by any young woman student of Journalism, (for my secretary assures me you must be a young woman on account of the hand writing.)

     With regard to my past it can all be summed up by saying I have been a promising young man in literary circles for at least thirty years. With regard to my present, I am in a very low and depressed state of mind, consequent upon having the greatest romantic drama ever written in America ("Out of the Sea") turn out to be a commercial failure; and in planning a campaign of wholesale murder, mayhem and arson against certain dramatic critics, not to mention a couple of actors. With regard to my future I have no hopes: fountains of evil which have welled up in me on account of various literary disappointments have no legal outlet in the way of dissipation: the time is past when one could get drunk and forget a licking.

     I have planned for myself an agreeable and debauched old age, a compensation for the respectability which I have had, hypocritically, to assume all through youth and my middle years; it is my desire to wind up in the gutter, free from all inhibitions, happy, red-nosed, unrespected, loved by everybody, and with no position in society to burden me.

     But it is so exceedingly difficult in these righteous days to achieve a state of pleasant and continuing dissipation that I fear I am to be balked even in this.

I am giving you a chart of my soul; and as I said, I do not think it is the sort of thing that really should be used in any reputable thesis in any conventional university. And having given you this map of my psychic purlieus, the mere physical details of my life, past, present and future, can really matter but very little.

If you must have facts, however, the facts are that I was born in a small town in Northern Illinois of poor but honest parents and the poverty and honesty which I inherited from them I have preserved intact throughout life, with the exception of here and there some brief prosperous interludes. I started writing because there seem to be nothing else so easy to get into for a person of no education and very few ideas. Such ideas as I have been able to express have always been used against me sooner or later; I would have got along a great deal better as a journalist if I had never had any at all. My advice to any class of journalism is to get rid of all ideas whatever right at the start and thus insured happiness and success in your chosen career.

I do not know what the function of a School of Journalism is, or I might be able to give more advice. I have seen several classes in Journalism and they all seem to me to be working very hard about nothing in particular. There isn't anything fundamental in the newspaper business as I have seen it, that couldn't be learned in five or six weeks by anyone who is capable of learning it.

A reporter gets out and gets a story and either telephones it to the office or comes in and writes it himself and there isn't anything to it that can't be picked up overnight by anyone who can use a typewriter and a telephone. The art of writing headlines is something that should be learned in a week. Writing editorials is merely a process of finding what the proprietor of the paper thinks that he thinks and putting it into decent English.

Of course, he never knows what he thinks until he finds out what the most influential advertisers think and the influential advertisers usually never think at all: they just have business convictions. So you see that editorial writing is really quite simple.

The trouble with the newspaper business--or Journalism as the sly word is--is that one thinks early in the game that it is really important; and late in the game one cannot think of it as being as important as it might really be made.

But I suppose the chief iniquity in the newspaper business really lies in the fact that it cuts down thousands and millions of acres of fine trees in order to make paper pulp. The trees are worth far more in a physical and spiritual way than anything that will ever be printed on the paper which they become. There is no way to stop this savage and beastial destruction of forests, for there is no way to impress the public consumers with the rank hellishness of it: publishers in general do not wish the public to become overly interested in it. And unfortunately, it is an era in which the public, more or less, rules. A really enlightened despotism might do something about it, but Democracy is the fashion of the moment in spite of the fact that the plain teachings both of religious prophets and evolutionary scientists point to the superiority of the aristocratic system.

I have another play in rehearsal which I hope will be a success. If it should succeed my view of my own future, and the future of the world in general will probably change at once: that is to say they may not have any more truth in them, but they should prove much pleasant reading.
